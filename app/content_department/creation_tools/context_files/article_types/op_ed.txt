An op-ed (opinion-editorial) article presents the author's personal 
viewpoint on current issues, combining informed analysis with 
persuasive argumentation to influence public opinion and policy 
debates. This format allows journalists and experts to move beyond 
objective reporting to advocate for specific positions or solutions.

STRUCTURE:
- Compelling hook that grabs attention and establishes relevance
- Clear thesis statement presenting the author's position
- 2-3 main supporting arguments with evidence and examples
- Acknowledgment and refutation of counterarguments
- Strong conclusion with call to action or clear takeaway
- Typically 600-800 words for newspaper publication

APPROACH:
Op-eds blend personal expertise with broader public interest, using 
the author's unique perspective or experience to illuminate issues. 
They balance passion with credibility, making emotional appeals while 
grounding arguments in facts, data, and logical reasoning. The writing 
is more personal than news articles but more substantive than pure 
opinion pieces.

TONE AND LANGUAGE:
The tone is confident and authoritative while remaining accessible 
to general audiences. Language is more vivid and engaging than straight 
news writing, using rhetorical devices, analogies, and compelling 
examples to make points memorable. The author's voice comes through 
clearly while maintaining professional credibility.

PURPOSE:
To contribute to public discourse by offering informed perspectives 
on important issues. Op-eds aim to persuade readers, influence policy 
makers, and shape public debate through reasoned argument and expert 
insight. They serve democracy by providing platforms for diverse 
viewpoints and encouraging civic engagement.
