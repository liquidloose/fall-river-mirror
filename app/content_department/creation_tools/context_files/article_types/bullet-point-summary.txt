A bullet-point summary distills an article or document into its core 
points, presented as concise, scannable items. This format is designed 
for maximum information density in minimal space.

STRUCTURE:
- Each bullet is a single key point or takeaway
- Points are ordered by importance, not chronology
- No introductory or concluding paragraphs needed
- Total output must stay UNDER 900 characters

APPROACH:
Extract only the most essential facts, decisions, or outcomes. 
Strip away all supporting detail, quotes, and context. Each 
bullet should stand alone as a complete thought. Aim for 5-8 
bullets maximum.

TONE AND LANGUAGE:
Extremely direct and factual. Use active voice, present tense 
where possible. No transitional phrases, hedging language, or 
attribution. Just the facts.

FORMAT:
• Point one
• Point two
• Point three

PURPOSE:
To provide a rapid-scan summary that a reader can absorb in 
seconds. Useful for image generation prompts, social media 
previews, or quick reference.

This content needs to be returned in wcag-compliant HTML and CSS. A full HTML document is not needed. 
You just need to provide a bullet list summary inside of an <article></article> tag
