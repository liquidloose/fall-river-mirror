A profile article presents a comprehensive portrait of an individual, 
revealing character, motivations, and significance through detailed 
reporting, observation, and storytelling. This format humanizes 
public figures and introduces readers to people whose stories illuminate 
larger themes or issues.

STRUCTURE:
- Compelling scene or anecdote that captures the subject's essence
- Background establishing who the person is and why they matter
- Chronological or thematic exploration of their life/work
- Multiple interviews revealing different aspects of personality
- Observations of the subject in various settings or situations
- Analysis of their impact, significance, or broader relevance
- Conclusion that provides lasting impression or insight

APPROACH:
Profile writing requires extensive time with subjects, observing 
them in different contexts and conducting multiple interviews. The 
writer seeks to understand not just what the person has done, but 
who they are and what drives them. The approach balances admiration 
with critical assessment, avoiding both puff pieces and hatchet jobs.

TONE AND LANGUAGE:
The tone adapts to the subject while maintaining journalistic integrity. 
Language is descriptive and character-revealing, using specific 
details, dialogue, and behavioral observations to bring the person 
to life on the page. The writing shows rather than tells, letting 
readers form their own impressions through accumulated evidence.

PURPOSE:
To help readers understand influential or interesting people in 
their communities, revealing the human stories behind public roles. 
Profiles can illuminate broader social issues through individual 
experience, inspire readers through examples of achievement or 
resilience, or simply satisfy curiosity about notable figures.
