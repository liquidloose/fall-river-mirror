A critical article examines subjects through a lens of rigorous analysis 
and evaluation, questioning assumptions, exposing weaknesses, and 
challenging conventional wisdom. This format goes beyond simple 
reporting to offer substantive critique of policies, decisions, 
institutions, or public figures based on evidence and reasoned argument.

STRUCTURE:
- Strong thesis statement identifying what is being criticized and why
- Background context establishing the subject's significance
- Systematic examination of flaws, contradictions, or failures
- Evidence supporting critical claims (data, examples, expert testimony)
- Analysis of broader implications or consequences
- Conclusion reinforcing the critical assessment

APPROACH:
The writing maintains intellectual rigor while building a compelling 
case for why the subject deserves criticism. It distinguishes between 
personal attacks and legitimate policy critique, focusing on actions, 
decisions, and their consequences rather than character assassination. 
The criticism is constructive when possible, suggesting alternatives 
or improvements.

TONE AND LANGUAGE:
Critical articles use precise, analytical language that demonstrates 
serious engagement with the subject. They avoid inflammatory rhetoric 
while still conveying the significance of identified problems. The 
tone is skeptical but fair, questioning claims and examining evidence 
rather than accepting official explanations at face value.

PURPOSE:
To hold public figures, institutions, and policies accountable by 
subjecting them to rigorous scrutiny. Critical articles serve the 
public interest by exposing problems that might otherwise go unnoticed 
and by encouraging more thoughtful decision-making through the prospect 
of informed critique.
