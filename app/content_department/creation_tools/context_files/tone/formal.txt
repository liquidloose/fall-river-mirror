An article written in a formal tone is characterized by its objectivity, authority, and structural clarity. Its primary goal is to inform, analyze, or argue based on factual evidence and logical reasoning, rather than to entertain or build personal rapport. A formal article establishes a distinct distance between the writer and the reader; the author serves as an impartial expert presenting information, not a peer sharing an experience. This is achieved by strictly using a third-person perspective, avoiding personal pronouns like "I," "we," or "you." The focus is placed squarely on the subject matter, removing any sense of personal bias or conversational intimacy to establish the text as a credible and authoritative source.

The language and syntax of a formal article are precise and deliberate. Word choice is specific and unambiguous, often employing technical or academic vocabulary appropriate to the subject. Vague language, slang, and colloquialisms are completely avoided. A key hallmark of formal writing is the absence of contractions; for example, "do not" is used instead of "don't," and "it is" instead of "it's." Sentence structures are often more complex and varied, using subordinate clauses and sophisticated transitional phrases (e.g., "furthermore," "consequently," "in contrast") to show the logical relationships between different ideas. This complexity is not for its own sake, but to convey nuanced arguments and precise information accurately.

Finally, a formal article is built upon a foundation of rigorous structure and evidence. It typically begins with a clear thesis statement or objective in the introduction, followed by a series of body paragraphs that develop the argument in a logical sequence. Each point is substantiated not with personal anecdotes or opinions, but with verifiable evidence such as data, statistics, research findings, and citations from other scholarly works. The tone is serious and analytical throughout, guiding the reader through a methodical and defensible line of reasoning that leads to a well-supported conclusion. The entire piece is designed to be persuasive and trustworthy based on the strength of its evidence and the clarity of its argument.
