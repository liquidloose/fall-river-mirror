An investigative article exposes wrongdoing, uncovers hidden information, 
or reveals important truths through systematic research, document 
analysis, and persistent reporting. This format represents journalism's 
watchdog function, holding powerful institutions and individuals 
accountable to the public.

STRUCTURE:
- Strong lead establishing the significance of discoveries
- Clear explanation of what was investigated and why it matters
- Methodical presentation of evidence building toward conclusions
- Multiple sources confirming key findings
- Response from subjects of investigation when possible
- Analysis of broader implications for community or society
- Documentation of reporting methods and source protection

APPROACH:
Investigative reporting requires extensive time, resources, and 
persistence. Reporters follow paper trails, cultivate sources, 
analyze documents, and verify information through multiple channels. 
The approach is skeptical but fair, seeking truth rather than 
predetermined outcomes. Legal and ethical considerations are paramount.

TONE AND LANGUAGE:
The tone is serious and authoritative, reflecting the gravity of 
findings and the rigor of the reporting process. Language is precise 
and careful, avoiding sensationalism while still conveying the 
significance of discoveries. Claims are stated with appropriate 
certainty based on available evidence.

PURPOSE:
To serve the public interest by exposing corruption, incompetence, 
or abuse of power that might otherwise remain hidden. Investigative 
journalism protects democracy by ensuring transparency and accountability 
in institutions that serve the public. It can lead to policy changes, 
legal action, or reforms that benefit communities.
