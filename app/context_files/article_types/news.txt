A news article delivers timely, factual information about recent events 
using the traditional journalism format that prioritizes objectivity, 
accuracy, and public service. This fundamental format serves as the 
backbone of daily journalism, informing citizens about developments 
that affect their communities and lives.

STRUCTURE:
- Inverted pyramid: most important information first
- Lead paragraph answering who, what, when, where, why, how
- Supporting paragraphs with quotes, details, and context
- Background information for reader understanding
- Attribution for all claims and information sources
- Typically 300-600 words for daily news coverage

APPROACH:
News writing maintains strict objectivity, presenting facts without 
editorial comment or interpretation. Multiple sources are consulted 
and quoted to provide balanced coverage. The reporter's role is to 
gather and verify information, not to advocate for particular positions 
or outcomes. Speed and accuracy are both essential.

TONE AND LANGUAGE:
The tone is neutral and professional, using clear, direct language 
accessible to general audiences. Technical terms are explained when 
necessary. The writing avoids loaded language, emotional appeals, 
or subjective characterizations. Sentences are generally shorter 
and more straightforward than in feature writing.

PURPOSE:
To inform the public about significant events, developments, and 
issues in a timely, accurate, and unbiased manner. News articles 
serve democracy by providing citizens with the factual information 
they need to make informed decisions about their communities and 
government. They create a shared foundation of knowledge for public 
discourse.
