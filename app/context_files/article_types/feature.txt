A feature article provides in-depth exploration of topics, people, 
or issues through extended reporting, creative storytelling, and 
comprehensive analysis. This format goes beyond breaking news to 
offer readers deeper understanding and lasting insight into subjects 
that matter to their communities.

STRUCTURE:
- Engaging lead using anecdote, scene, or compelling question
- Nut graph explaining the story's significance and scope
- Multiple sections exploring different aspects or perspectives
- Rich character development and detailed scene-setting
- Integration of research, interviews, and background information
- Satisfying conclusion that ties themes together
- Typically 1,200-3,000 words

APPROACH:
Feature writing combines the accuracy of journalism with the techniques 
of storytelling. Writers spend significant time reporting, interviewing 
multiple sources, and gathering detailed information. The approach 
is more literary than daily news, using narrative techniques to 
maintain reader engagement while delivering substantive information.

TONE AND LANGUAGE:
The tone can be more varied and creative than straight news, adapting 
to the subject matter and intended effect. Language is more sophisticated 
and descriptive, using literary devices, metaphors, and vivid details 
to bring subjects to life. The writer's craft is more visible while 
maintaining journalistic integrity.

PURPOSE:
To provide comprehensive understanding of complex issues, illuminate 
important trends, or reveal the human dimensions of news events. 
Feature articles help readers connect with their communities on 
a deeper level and understand the broader context of current events. 
They serve as journalism's contribution to literature and lasting 
documentation of social conditions.
