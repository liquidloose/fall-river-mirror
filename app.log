                <p># Voices from Fall River: Reflecting on the Transgender Day of Remembrance</p>
        <p>FALL RIVER — In a gathering marked by personal testimonies, historical context, and a solemn reading of names, community members came together at City Hall for the Transgender Day of Remembrance, highlighting the ongoing challenges faced by transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming individuals. The event, organized by the Fall River Pride Committee, featured speakers who shared their experiences of discrimination, threats, and resilience, while commemorating those lost to violence over the past year.</p>
        <p>Sean Connell, a proud trans, non-binary, and gender non-conforming resident born and raised in Fall River, opened the discussion by addressing the threats they received while preparing for the event. Connell emphasized that queer people have been sexualized and punished for centuries, pointing to global statistics: around 30 countries allow same-sex marriage, while about 70 still jail or execute individuals for their identities. They highlighted the inconvenience of queer visibility in media, contrasting it with the real harm of hate speech in their hometown, including messages urging suicide. Connell, who has lived in various parts of the city and worked as an educator and mentor, stressed that their story is not unique, urging the audience to combat stigma that contributes to higher suicide rates among queer individuals—two to five times the general population.</p>
        <p>Drawing from personal history, Connell explained their identity as agender, meaning they feel no connection to masculine or feminine genders. They recounted discovering the term during high school research on transgender rights, initially as an ally, and the challenges of coming out. In a lighter moment, Connell shared their coming-out story to their mother, who humorously compared their pronouns (zer/zim) to a cartoon character, leading to an accepting response. This narrative underscored the importance of safe spaces like LGBTQ+ after-school programs, which provided support for Connell and others.</p>
        <p>Other speakers built on these themes, addressing misconceptions and violence. One participant recounted false accusations against events like drag queen story times, where critics claimed inappropriate activities occurred, labeling them as lies that fuel hatred. They noted that dozens of trans and gender non-conforming people were murdered in the U.S. in the past year alone, challenging the notion that queer communities are the aggressors. The speaker critiqued the use of religious rhetoric to demonize queer identities, pointing out that no widespread "gay missionaries" exist to proselytize, yet queer people are accused of forcing their lifestyles on others.</p>
        <p>A young speaker shared their journey on testosterone and receiving a binder, rereading a poem written at age 14 about feeling trapped in the wrong body. The poem vividly described the desire for physical freedom, like swimming without restrictive clothing, and affirmed their identity with the declaration, "I am real. I am here. I AM ME." This personal reflection tied into broader discussions of gender-affirming care, which speakers described as life-saving, amid struggles to access it.</p>
        <p>The event also featured a transgender woman from a prominent New England drag family, who provided historical context for the Transgender Day of Remembrance. She explained that the observance began 26 years ago in Boston, just 58 miles away, initiated by a transgender woman and allies in response to violence. At 41, having come out at 38 and started estrogen therapy, she emphasized that trans people simply want to live ordinary lives—going to work, raising families, and being treated as people. She proudly flies a trans flag outside her home, symbolizing defiance against daily hardships.</p>
        <p>Throughout the gathering, speakers addressed the political climate, noting how gender non-conforming individuals challenge patriarchal norms and binaries. They referenced scientific consensus on gender and sex as spectrums, supported by experiences across billions of people worldwide. Historical examples included gender non-conforming documentation from 10,000 years ago in Sicily and early gender-affirming surgeries in the 1920s, countering claims that these identities are modern inventions.</p>
        <p>A key moment came with the reading of names of those lost to violence in the U.S. over the past 12 months. Rachel Lumis, secretary of the Fall River Pride Committee, listed over 50 individuals, including Anie Walker, Megan Jordan, Phoenix Cassetta, and many others, some known only by partial details or aliases. The list highlighted the scale of the tragedy, with speakers noting that the global tally is far larger. The event concluded with a moment of silence as the trans flag was raised to half-mast at City Hall, where it would fly for the week alongside lights and an art exhibit.</p>
        <p>Public participation was evident, with applause following personal stories and poems, showing community engagement. Speakers encouraged outreach to the Fall River Pride Committee for support, emphasizing that the city is a home for queer individuals and that resources are available to combat isolation. Connell closed by inviting those feeling unsafe to connect, reinforcing the event's role in building solidarity.</p>
        <p>This year's remembrance, the fourth in Fall River, has grown from a small riverside walk to a City Hall event, reflecting increasing local involvement. While no formal decisions were made, the discussions underscored calls for equal access to gender-affirming care and protection from violence, framed against a backdrop of global and historical inequities. The gathering served as both a memorial and a platform for sharing lived experiences, fostering awareness in the community.</p>

Historical examples included gender non-conforming documentation from 10,000 years ago in Sicily and early gender-affirming surgeries in the 1920s, countering claims that these identities are modern inventions.</p>
        <p>A key moment came with the reading of names of those lost to violence in the U.S. over the past 12 months. Rachel Lumis, secretary of the Fall River Pride Committee, listed over 50 individuals, including Anie Walker, Megan Jordan, Phoenix Cassetta, and many others, some known only by partial details or aliases. The list highlighted the scale of the tragedy, with speakers noting that the global tally is far larger. The event concluded with a moment of silence as the trans flag was raised to half-mast at City Hall, where it would fly for the week alongside lights and an art exhibit.</p>
        <p>Public participation was evident, with applause following personal stories and poems, showing community engagement. Speakers encouraged outreach to the Fall River Pride Committee for support, emphasizing that the city is a home for queer individuals and that resources are available to combat isolation. Connell closed by inviting those feeling unsafe to connect, reinforcing the event's role in building solidarity.</p>
        <p>This year's remembrance, the fourth in Fall River, has grown from a small riverside walk to a City Hall event, reflecting increasing local involvement. While no formal decisions were made, the discussions underscored calls for equal access to gender-affirming care and protection from violence, framed against a backdrop of global and historical inequities. The gathering served as both a memorial and a platform for sharing lived experiences, fostering awareness in the community.</p>

        <h1 id="article-title">Fall River Hero Surprised After 52 Years of Service</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="article-body">
                <p># Surprise Honor for Fall River's Unsung Hero: John Sulio's 52 Years at the Boys and Girls Club</p>
        <p>FALL RIVER – In a heartwarming twist that caught everyone off guard, what started as an apparent gathering to honor Lenny Sylvia turned out to be a clever ruse to celebrate John Sulio, a lifelong pillar of the Boys and Girls Club. The event, held at the club's facility, brought together community leaders, family, and friends to recognize Sulio's nearly four decades of dedication to the youth of Fall River, highlighting his profound impact on countless lives through mentorship and community service.</p>
        <p>The ceremony kicked off with a lighthearted reveal. Attendees were initially told they were there for Sylvia, but the emcee quickly pivoted, announcing the real focus: John Sulio, who has been involved with the club for close to 40 years—actually, as details emerged, a staggering 52 years in total, starting from his days as a young member. This surprise element set a joyful tone, drawing laughter and applause from the crowd as Sulio was called forward.</p>
        <p>Mayor Vic Pereira, referred to affectionately as "Mr. Mayor or Vic," was one of the first to speak, sharing personal anecdotes about Sulio's influence. Pereira recounted how Sulio had changed his own life during his youth at the club, crediting him with shaping who he is today. "I would not be here today without John's influences," Pereira said, emphasizing Sulio's role in guiding him and others. He went on to declare, "John Sulio is the Boys and Girls Club," underscoring the man's synonymous connection to the organization.</p>
        <p>Another speaker delved into Sulio's backstory, painting a vivid picture of his long history with the club. Born in 1959, Sulio was present at the building's dedication in 1967, where the late Senator Ted Kennedy spoke. As a child, he joined by paying modest annual dues of a dollar or two. By his sophomore year at Durfee High School—where he excelled in graphic arts and track and field—Sulio began working part-time at the club, handling tasks like checking coats and distributing sports equipment. After graduating at age 16, he transitioned to full-time work under mentor Al Carrera, who hired him on his 18th birthday.</p>
        <p>The speaker highlighted Sulio's hands-on contributions, such as his time working in the pool and his efforts to engage neighborhood kids. One notable example involved persuading local youths, including a young Vic Pereira, to swap street hockey for organized basketball at the club. This shift not only fostered athletic skills but also led to broader community benefits, with Pereira himself becoming a prominent educator and athlete.</p>
        <p>In recognition of these efforts, Sulio received the Fall River Icon Award, presented courtesy of Louis Leoo and his Axis Bat Company. The award included a custom-engraved bat, symbolizing his 52 years of service. "For John's tremendous efforts to improve the lives of our kids, we honor him," the presenter stated, as the crowd erupted in applause. Sulio, visibly moved, accepted the honor and shared his thanks, noting he had no idea the event was for him.</p>
        <p>Sulio's acceptance speech was humble and reflective. He expressed gratitude to everyone present, the club's staff, and the members he's worked with over the years. "I would like to thank all the members of the club that I had the pleasure of all my years being here of making a difference in their lives," he said. He admitted the recognition overwhelmed him, affirming his positive impact and his love for the kids and staff. "It just overwhelms me to think that I could have such a positive impact, but I did," Sulio added, his words met with more applause.</p>
        <p>The event drew several notable figures who added their voices to the tributes. New city councilor Mike came forward, speaking of knowing Sulio through Holy Name Church and praising his community involvement. "He's always been a wonderful man, always helping out in the community," he said, thanking Sulio for his service.</p>
        <p>State Representative Carol Fiola and Senator Mike Rogers also spoke, presenting Sulio with a citation from the state. Fiola, who described herself as both Sulio's representative and friend, noted the widespread recognition he receives from former club kids. "Every child that you run into wherever you go, hi John. Hi, John. They know you," she said, highlighting his enduring family ties and the club's role as his "home." The citation thanked him for being an icon in Fall River.</p>
        <p>Senator Rogers echoed these sentiments, recalling their long friendship and Sulio's constant presence at the club. "Every time I came in, see your smiling face," Rogers said. He praised Sulio's contributions to the community and youth, noting how many former club members are now adults giving back. Rogers shared a personal touch, mentioning his grandson had just joined the club, and affirmed the organization's importance to the city.</p>
        <p>A family member, identifying as the "baby of the bunch" in the Sulio family, closed the formal remarks by thanking organizers, including Louis Leoo and friend Phil Sylvia. They acknowledged the community's support for Sulio, saying, "Today is recognition of John's commitment to the youth of Fall River," and expressed family pride in his journey.</p>
        <p>Following the ceremony, an informal interview with Sulio provided deeper insights into his experiences. When asked about encounters with former club kids now adults, Sulio described it as "truly unbelievable." He explained how these interactions evolve from playful club activities to warm greetings in everyday settings, often involving their children or grandchildren. "Whenever they see me, they do not think twice about hey I got to say hi to John," he said.</p>
        <p>Sulio addressed the non-financial rewards of his work, stating, "What I do not get in financial money, I make up tenfold in my heart, the good feeling that I get that I know I made a difference." He shared stories of connecting with shy or isolated children through games like ping-pong or pool, intentionally letting them win to build confidence and foster attachments. "I've made another connection. And that's all I aim to do. Make connections," he emphasized.</p>
        <p>On the lessons he hopes to impart, Sulio expressed a desire for former members to carry forward the example he set: "I want them to be the example that I set for them, to spread the same love, laughter, and joy that they bring to my life and to share it with other members."</p>
        <p>Acknowledging Fall River's challenges, including poverty and absent family figures, Sulio confirmed he often stepped into mentor roles. "Yes, that was a very humbling and rewarding feeling that I get," he said, noting his efforts to help as many as possible without claiming full credit.</p>
        <p>The event wrapped with repeated thanks from Sulio to the staff, community, and children served by the club, reinforcing the collective effort behind its success. Public participation was evident throughout, with applause, laughter, and personal stories showing strong local engagement. While no formal decisions or emergencies were part of this gathering—it was purely celebratory—the tributes collectively affirmed Sulio's role in building a supportive environment for Fall River's youth.</p>
        <p>This ceremony not only honored one man's dedication but also spotlighted the Boys and Girls Club's ongoing mission. As speakers noted, Sulio's story reflects broader themes of community investment, where individual efforts ripple out to influence generations. In a city like Fall River, such recognitions serve as reminders of the quiet heroes who shape its future, one connection at a time.</p>

    </header>
    <div class="article-body">
                <p># Fall River Licensing Board Approves Key Transfers and Renewals in Year-End Meeting</p>
        <p>FALL RIVER — In a session focused on business transitions and annual renewals, the Fall River Licensing Board granted several license transfers and extensions while approving a slate of 2026 renewals for local establishments, reflecting ongoing shifts in the city's hospitality and auto sectors.</p>
        <p>The meeting kicked off with a discussion on a lodging house license application from the Fall River Community Housing Resource Board for the property at 202 Rock Street. Board Chairman Gregory Brian clarified that the request was for the existing setup, not an expansion, following the board's purchase of the property earlier in the year. Applicant Stacy Demora explained that the previous owner, Thomas Pastinac, had not informed them of the need for a new permit, leading to overlapping renewals. The board confirmed no immediate plans for additional units and, after noting no public input in favor or opposition, unanimously approved the license.</p>
        <p>Next, the board addressed changes at The Liberal Club at 20 Star Street. Paul L. DeForge Jr. presented requests for updates to officers, directors, and LLC managers, along with one-time extensions of operating hours. These extensions apply to Thanksgiving Eve (November 26), New Year's Eve (December 31), and Super Bowl Sunday (February 8), allowing operations until 1 a.m. DeForge confirmed the club had similar extensions in the past without issues. Police reports indicated no concerns, and with no public comments, the board approved the changes.</p>
        <p>A similar set of corporate adjustments came up for Tequila Lime Cantina, where Attorney Cheryl Bernard represented Nicholas Ozog in his bid to take over as manager and stockholder. Ozog, who has over 20 years in the liquor business and owns another local establishment, emphasized that operations would remain unchanged. The board verified no police objections and approved the transfer of stock, change of manager, officers, directors, and LLC managers after a brief discussion and no public opposition.</p>
        <p>The Fall River Sports Club at 233 Hope Street sought comparable updates, with Jean Rigo stepping in as the new manager. Rigo, who has bartending experience but no prior license management, noted he had trained under the outgoing manager and planned to dedicate 30 to 40 hours weekly to the role. He described the move as an effort to inject new energy into the aging club. Police had no objections, and the board approved the changes without public input.</p>
        <p>License transfers formed a core part of the agenda, starting with TTC Entertainment LLC's application for 1019 South Main Street, formerly Patty's Pub. Tan Nguyen, represented by Attorney Hong Tran, outlined plans to convert the space into a pho and ramen restaurant, introducing Vietnamese noodle soups to an area lacking such options. Nguyen detailed modest interior decorations and operating hours from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. weekdays, extending to 1 a.m. on weekends. He confirmed a family-run operation with an experienced chef, and the board approved the transfer, noting no police issues or public comments.</p>
        <p>Another transfer went to JNMN LLC for the Modern Snack Bar at 347-351 Alden Street. Attorney David Assad represented Joel Msia, who had purchased the real estate and intended to maintain current operations. Assad specified hours: 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Wednesday, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. Thursday, 6 a.m. to 2 a.m. Friday and Saturday, and 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sunday (with alcohol service starting at 10 a.m. on Sundays). Msia, who operates another food spot in the city, planned to be on-site about 35 hours weekly. Police reports showed no concerns, and the board granted the transfer unanimously.</p>
        <p>The bulk of the meeting involved renewing licenses for 2026. Dozens of common victualer licenses were approved for establishments ranging from fast-food chains like McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts to local spots such as Aladdin's Pizza, Raising Cane's, and Lebanese Pita Pocket. These renewals cover a wide array of dining options across the city, ensuring continuity for businesses like Chipotle, Taco Bell, and various bakeries and cafes.</p>
        <p>Auto-related licenses—class one, two, and three—were also renewed en masse for over 50 dealers and repair shops, including names like Empire Hyundai, Mattie Imports, and various independent sales lots. These approvals support the city's automotive economy, with no noted objections.</p>
        <p>Fortune teller licenses were renewed for three locations: Liu Ken Holdings at 1554 Pleasant Street, Sally's Palm Reading at 1022 South Main Street, and Psychic Readings by Taylor at 121 Brighton Avenue. Lodging house renewals included properties at 202 Rock Street (under Thomas Pastinac, separate from the earlier application), 517 South Main Street, 621 Second Street, 33 Oak Street, and several managed by Ronaldi Peace Operations LLC.</p>
        <p>Under old business, the board revisited Grand Motors LLC's request for a new location at 104 Anawan Street. James Sylvester presented an updated lease providing 325 square feet of office space and 24 full parking spots. The board confirmed police approval and granted the class two wholesale auto sales license.</p>
        <p>Public engagement was minimal; a sign-up sheet for citizen input was available, but no one participated. The meeting highlighted the board's role in facilitating smooth business transitions, with all decisions made unanimously after verifying compliance and police feedback. No emergencies were discussed, and the session wrapped with approvals for the board's 2026 meeting schedule.</p>
        <p>This meeting underscores the licensing board's routine oversight of Fall River's commercial landscape, balancing new ventures with established operations to keep the local economy moving forward. (Word count: 752)</p>

        <h1 id="article-title">Fall River Council Clashes on Reforms, Hires, Labor Woes</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="article-body">
                <p>### Fall River City Council Tackles Charter Reforms, Key Appointments, and Labor Concerns in Marathon Session</p>
        <p>In a lengthy and at times heated meeting, the Fall River City Council delved into a range of issues, from revising the city's governing charter to confirming high-level appointments and scrutinizing labor agreements. The session highlighted ongoing tensions over governance, equity in city operations, and the need for accountability, with public input setting the tone early on.</p>
        <p>The meeting kicked off with citizen Richard Branco voicing strong opinions on the city's charter during public comment. Drawing from his background in racing and rulebooks, Branco criticized the current charter as a "magic trick" that discourages broader participation in local politics. He argued it creates an "exclusive club" that's tough for average residents to break into, urging the council to scrap it and start over. Branco's remarks framed much of the subsequent discussion on the special charter review committee's report, which had been tabled from a previous meeting.</p>
        <p>The committee, chaired by Reena Brown and supported by clerk Tim Campos, presented recommendations aimed at refining the charter without a full rewrite. Key proposals included splitting recall elections into two stages—one to vote on removal and another for replacement—to avoid past litigation pitfalls. They also addressed conflicts like city employees seeking school committee seats, lowered signature requirements for ballot access from 150 to 100, and clarified rules on felons in office, emphasizing constitutional limits. The group suggested handling felony convictions tied to official duties by vacating the position upon conviction. Discussions revealed council concerns over inconsistencies with state laws, such as cooling-off periods for former officials taking city jobs, and calls for more user-friendly references to state statutes.</p>
        <p>Councilors debated the report's path forward, noting it was essentially advisory. Some pushed for immediate action toward ballot placement, while others favored waiting for the mandatory 10-year review in 2027 to avoid overcrowding the 2026 ballot. The council ultimately accepted the report for filing and website posting, leaving substantive changes for future consideration. This decision reflected a cautious approach, acknowledging the committee's two-year effort but prioritizing broader input.</p>
        <p>Appointments dominated the agenda, sparking debates on contract terms and qualifications. The council confirmed Emily Arky as director of financial services, but only after amending the motion to specify a one-year contract requiring re-approval. This stemmed from broader discussions on whether department heads' contracts should return for council ratification upon renewal, with corporation counsel Alan Rumsey advising that the charter focuses on initial confirmations of individuals, not ongoing contracts. Despite legal interpretations, councilors expressed frustration over perceived inconsistencies and the need for accountability.</p>
        <p>A more contentious appointment was Christopher Pino as director of community maintenance. Councilors questioned Pino's experience, noting his prior city roles in cemeteries and planning before leaving for another municipality and returning. Debates highlighted concerns about promoting from within, exit interview processes, and continuity, with some councilors citing a pattern of staff turnover. Pino was confirmed by a 6-3 vote, but not without calls for clearer performance plans from department leaders like Al Oliveira, who oversees multiple areas and emphasized Pino's administrative skills.</p>
        <p>The council unanimously confirmed Christopher Murphy as city auditor without significant debate.</p>
        <p>Labor issues arose with a proposed memorandum of agreement for the ASME Council 93 Local 3177 union. Councilors rejected it by a 6-3 vote, citing pay inequities between 911 dispatchers and those in the Mobile Integrated Health (MIH) program, where MIH dispatchers earn more despite handling fewer calls. Discussions revealed frustrations over recruitment challenges and calls for parity, with suggestions to revisit negotiations. Related transfers from the reserve fund and facilities salaries were tabled pending resolution.</p>
        <p>Other actions included approving loan orders for water system improvements totaling $8.9 million after amendments, and passing resolutions. One called for a traffic study at the William Street and Broadway intersection, amended to extend from Columbia to Middle Street due to safety concerns. Another sought performance audits of city departments, starting with one or two annually. A third proposed renaming committees to better address housing and facilities, sending it to the ordinance committee.</p>
        <p>The meeting underscored Fall River's focus on governance reforms and operational equity, with councilors pushing for transparency amid public and internal pressures. Outcomes like the charter report's filing and appointment confirmations signal incremental progress, while rejections highlight unresolved tensions in labor and management.</p>

        <h1 id="article-title">Fall River Parks Gear Up for Parking, Amenity Overhaul</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="article-body">
                <p># Fall River Park Board Advances Father Kelly Park Improvements Amid Broader Recreation Planning Talks</p>
        <p>FALL RIVER — In a focused session, the city's Park Board of Commissioners approved a letter of support for a proposed improvement project at Father Kelly Park, centering on adding off-street parking and other amenities to address community needs identified in recent surveys. The decision came during a Monday evening meeting where Director of Engineering and Planning Dan Aguar presented the initiative, tying it to the city's newly developed Open Space and Recreation Plan.</p>
        <p>Aguar outlined the proposal, which seeks funding from the Community Preservation Committee (CPC) for roughly $500,000 to create a small parking facility, updated landscaping, lighting, seating, and picnic areas in a less intrusive section of the park. He emphasized that the sketch provided was conceptual, with final designs subject to board input and adjustments based on surveys, tree locations, and available funding. The project aims to alleviate parking shortages during high-use periods like softball tournaments, where the park sees intense but sporadic activity.</p>
        <p>Commissioners engaged in a detailed discussion on maximizing the space, with one expressing concern about not fully utilizing the area for as many parking spots as possible. Aguar acknowledged the balance required, noting the site's historic walkways and the need to preserve the park's character rather than turning it into a dominant parking lot. He estimated the current concept could accommodate around 18 spots, with entry designed to minimize impact on street parking along Globe Street.</p>
        <p>The board's approval was conditional, specifying that the letter to CPC would endorse the project while reserving final authority for design approval. This move reflects ongoing efforts to integrate park improvements with data from the Open Space and Recreation Plan, which Aguar described as the result of two years of work involving public outreach, online surveys with 584 responses, and meetings. Key community priorities highlighted in the plan include safety enhancements, lighting, parking, and amenities like bathrooms, rather than building entirely new parks.</p>
        <p>Aguar shared that the plan's development revealed a strong public desire for better maintenance of existing facilities over new constructions. "The city of Fall River is great at building new things," he said, pointing to schools and parks as examples, but added that funding mechanisms for upkeep, such as painting or grass cutting, are often lacking. He advocated for a 10-year strategy of "shovel-ready" projects, including uniform installations like benches, to be presented annually to CPC for funding.</p>
        <p>Discussions extended to broader park challenges across the city. Commissioners and Aguar touched on underutilized spaces like Pulaski Park and Maplewood Park, where parking lots exist but face issues like inadequate lighting or misuse. For instance, Maplewood's lot is being upgraded with new lighting poles, but enforcement remains a concern, with reports of unsafe conditions and non-park-related parking. Aguar noted similar problems at other sites, such as illegal dumping and overnight storage of vehicles or equipment, underscoring the need for better ordinance enforcement.</p>
        <p>Public participation was minimal at the meeting, with no citizens signed up for input, aligning with Aguar's observations from the plan's outreach efforts. He recounted low turnout at public hearings, like one with only four residents despite extensive promotion, contrasting it with higher online engagement via social media complaints. To boost involvement, Aguar suggested reaching out to user groups, such as softball leagues, for feedback on the Father Kelly project.</p>
        <p>The board also briefly addressed two tree removal requests, approving both after confirmation from parks staff that the trees were dead or hazardous. One at 160 C Street came from resident Michael Montigney, and the other at 73 Grove Street from Darren Maderas. These approvals were straightforward, with staff inspections verifying the need.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, Aguar proposed collaborating with the board and new parks staff, including Darren (recently in a full-time role), to implement the recreation plan's goals. This includes creating a database of park amenities accessible via a city website, potentially with GIS mapping for activities like pickleball. He also mentioned forming an open space and recreation committee to monitor progress on the 10-year plan, which runs from 2025 to 2035 and is required by law.</p>
        <p>Commissioners reflected on shifting recreational trends, noting the decline of some little leagues while soccer and football groups seek more fields. One commissioner highlighted the need to repurpose underused baseball fields and basketball courts to match current demands, aligning with the plan's emphasis on improving existing assets.</p>
        <p>Funding strategies were a recurring theme. Aguar discussed phasing projects based on CPC allocations and potential city contributions, with commitments to offset costs once designs are finalized. He floated ideas like paid parking kiosks in lots during non-event times to generate maintenance revenue, drawing examples from other municipalities. This could address misuse, such as overnight parking or storage, seen in parks like Lafayette and a public lot at Columbia and Hunter streets.</p>
        <p>The meeting also connected the Father Kelly proposal to nearby infrastructure work, including a grant-funded reconstruction of Globe Four Corners that will remove some on-street parking. Aguar clarified that the park project isn't solely to compensate for those losses but to enhance overall accessibility.</p>
        <p>In related updates, Aguar mentioned reallocating funds from an extended Quequechan Rail Trail project, returning $3 million to focus on a single segment connecting to Father Travassos Park, prioritizing maintenance over expansion. He stressed that adding more trails without upkeep resources would strain the system, likening it to the perpetual painting of the Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
        <p>Board members expressed interest in elevating their role beyond routine approvals, aiming for higher-level discussions on park utilization and budget advocacy. One noted recent talks with the mayor about involving the board earlier in projects to ensure input before implementation.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Aguar referenced another CPC submission for a small park on Columbia Street, acquired from a church, indicating a pipeline of modest improvements.</p>
        <p>The commissioners voted unanimously to issue the support letter for Father Kelly Park, with no opposition. No emergencies were declared, and the board opted to skip a December meeting, reconvening in January to continue these discussions.</p>
        <p>This session underscores Fall River's push toward data-driven park enhancements, leveraging community input to tackle longstanding issues like parking and maintenance while fostering collaboration across departments. With the recreation plan as a foundation, the city appears poised to address resident priorities systematically. (Word count: 782)</p>

        <h1 id="article-title">Fall River Board Greenlights Business Boom for 2026</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="article-body">
                <p># Fall River Licensing Board Approves Key Transfers and Renewals in Year-End Meeting</p>
        <p>In a bustling session just before the holidays, the Fall River Licensing Board tackled a slate of license applications, transfers, and renewals, paving the way for several local businesses to move forward into 2026. Chaired by Gregory Brian with member Melanie Cado present, the board approved a range of items from lodging houses to liquor licenses, reflecting ongoing changes in the city's hospitality and auto sectors.</p>
        <p>The meeting kicked off with a lodging house license application for the Fall River Community Housing Resource Board at 202 Rock Street. Stacy Demora, representing the board, explained that the group had purchased the property in April and was seeking the license following a change in ownership from previous operator Thomas Pastinac. The board clarified that this application covered the existing setup without any expansions, which would require future inspections. After confirming no opposition and a brief discussion, the board unanimously approved the license.</p>
        <p>Next up was The Liberal Club at 20 Star Street, where Paul L. DeForge Jr. requested changes to officers, directors, and LLC managers, along with extensions of operating hours for three specific dates: November 26 (Thanksgiving Eve), December 31 (New Year's Eve), and February 8 (Super Bowl Sunday), all until 1 a.m. DeForge noted that similar extensions had been granted in the past without issues, and police reports confirmed no concerns. The board approved the changes and extensions after verifying the details.</p>
        <p>A significant transfer involved Tequila Lime Cantina, where Nicholas Ozog, represented by Attorney Cheryl Bernard, sought to take over operations through changes in manager, officers, directors, LLC managers, issuance and transfer of stock, and adding a new stockholder. Ozog, who has over 20 years in the liquor business and owns another local establishment, emphasized that hours and operations would remain unchanged. The board, noting no police objections, approved the petition unanimously.</p>
        <p>Similar changes were approved for the Fall River Sports Club at 233 Hope Street. Jean Rigo, the proposed new manager, outlined his bartending experience and plans to inject new energy into the aging club, committing to 30-40 hours per week on-site with guidance from the previous manager. The board confirmed no police issues and granted the changes to manager, officers, directors, and LLC managers.</p>
        <p>The board then addressed a license transfer for TTC Entertainment LLC at 1019 South Main Street, formerly Patty's Pub, to Tan New Yen. Represented by Attorney Hong Tran, Yen described plans to transform the space into a pho and ramen restaurant, a novel concept for the area featuring Vietnamese-style soups. Operating hours would be 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Thursday, extending to 1 a.m. on weekends. Yen, who will manage the family-run operation with an experienced chef, confirmed minimal interior changes. With no opposition and police approval, the transfer passed.</p>
        <p>Another transfer went to JNMN LLC for the Modern Snack Bar at 347-351 Alden Street. Attorney David Assad represented Johan Msia, who had purchased the real estate and plans to continue operations without alterations. Hours include 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Wednesday, extending later on Thursdays through Saturdays, and 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Sundays (with alcohol service starting at 10 a.m.). Msia, who operates another food spot in the city, will be on-site about 35 hours weekly. Police had no objections, and the board approved.</p>
        <p>A major portion of the meeting focused on 2026 renewals across multiple categories. Dozens of common victualler licenses were renewed for establishments like Bread Brazil Bakery, New York Bagel, various Dunkin' Donuts locations, McDonald's outlets, and others ranging from pizza shops to cafes and restaurants. These renewals ensure continuity for everyday eateries throughout Fall River.</p>
        <p>The board also renewed class one, two, and three auto licenses for numerous dealerships and repair shops, including Express Courtesy Court, Brad's Auto Sales, Tony's Gas and Repair, and many more, covering sales, repairs, and wholesale operations. Fortune teller licenses were renewed for three locations: Liu Ken Holdings at 1554 Pleasant Street, Sally's Palm Reading at 1022 South Main Street, and Psychic Greetings by Taylor at 121 Brighton Avenue.</p>
        <p>Lodging house renewals included properties like Thomas Pastinac's at 202 Rock Street (noting the recent ownership shift), Park Rooms at 517 South Main Street, and several managed by Raldi Peace Operations LLC on Fort and Rodman Streets.</p>
        <p>Under old business, the board revisited Grand Motors LLC's request for a new location at 104 Anawan Street. James Sylvester presented an updated lease with office space and 242 square feet for operations. After confirming it met requirements and police approval, the board granted the class two wholesale auto sales license.</p>
        <p>The meeting wrapped with approvals for the board's 2026 meeting schedule and the minutes from October 14, 2025. Public participation was limited but present, with applicants like Demora, DeForge, Ozog, Rigo, Yen, Msia, and Sylvester directly engaging in discussions. No opposition was voiced on any item, indicating broad community support or neutrality. These decisions highlight Fall River's evolving business landscape, from new dining options to streamlined operations in established venues, setting the stage for a stable start to the new year.

She noted that the previous owner, Thomas Pastinac, had not informed them of the licensing requirement, leading to this application amid his own renewal process. The board approved the petition without opposition, maintaining the current configuration.</p>
        <p>Shifting to liquor-related matters, the Liberal Club at 20 Star Street requested changes to officers, directors, LLC managers, and a one-time extension of hours for three specific events. Paul L. DeForge Jr., the new manager, outlined extensions until 1 a.m. for Thanksgiving Eve (November 26), New Year's Eve (December 31), and Super Bowl Sunday (February 8). DeForge confirmed no issues from prior extensions, and with police approval noted as unnecessary, the board granted the changes unanimously.</p>
        <p>Similar updates came for the Tequila Lime Cantina, where Nicholas Ozog sought a change of manager, officers, directors, LLC managers, issuance and transfer of stock, and recognition as a new stockholder. Attorney Cheryl Bernard represented Ozog, who has over 20 years in the liquor business and owns another local establishment. The transfer keeps operations unchanged, and the board approved it after confirming no police objections.</p>
        <p>The Fall River Sports Club at 233 Hope Street followed suit, with Jean Rigo stepping in as the new manager amid changes to officers, directors, and LLC managers. Rigo, who has bartending experience but no prior license management, plans to commit 30-40 hours weekly, supported by the outgoing manager. The board approved the updates, noting the aim to inject new energy into the aging club, with no police concerns raised.</p>
        <p>License transfers highlighted the meeting's focus on evolving local dining scenes. TTC Entertainment LLC, represented by Tenu Yen and attorney Hong Tran, took over Patty's Pub at 1019 South Main Street to convert it into a pho and ramen restaurant. Yen described minimal interior changes and hours from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. weekdays, extending to 1 a.m. on weekends. With Yen's family-run operation backed by an experienced chef and no police objections, the board approved the transfer.</p>
        <p>Another transfer went to JNMN LLC for the Modern Snack Bar at 347-351 Alden Street. Attorney David Assad explained that owner Joel Msia, who operates another food spot on Rhode Island Avenue, would maintain existing hours—6 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Wednesday, extending later on Thursdays through Saturdays, and 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sundays (with alcohol service starting at 10 a.m. on Sundays). No changes to the interior or operations were planned, and the board granted the transfer without issue.</p>
        <p>The bulk of the agenda involved renewing a wide array of 2026 licenses, demonstrating the board's oversight of diverse sectors. Dozens of common victualler licenses were renewed for establishments like Bread Brazil Bakery, New York Bagel, various Dunkin' Donuts locations, McDonald's outlets, and specialty spots such as Lebanese Pita Pocket and Florentina's Italian Restaurant. These renewals cover everything from fast food chains to local eateries, ensuring continuity for over 100 businesses across the city.</p>
        <p>Auto-related licenses also saw mass renewals, including class one, two, and three for dealers like Express Courtesy Court, Brad's Auto Sales, and Empire Ford. The list encompassed repair shops, wholesalers, and sales lots, with no reported issues prompting denials.</p>
        <p>Fortune teller licenses were renewed for three operations: Liu Ken Holdings at 1554 Pleasant Street, Sally's Palm Reading at 1022 South Main Street, and Psychic Readings by Taylor at 121 Brighton Avenue. Lodging house renewals included Thomas Pastinac's at 202 Rock Street (distinct from the earlier application), Park Rooms at 517 South Main Street, and several properties managed by Ronaldi Peace Operations LLC.</p>
        <p>Under old business, the board revisited Grand Motors LLC's request for a new location at 104 Anawan Street. James Sylvester presented an updated lease providing 242 square feet of office space, addressing prior concerns. The board approved the class two wholesale auto sales license relocation, noting police clearance.</p>
        <p>Public participation was minimal, with no sign-ups for citizen input and no speakers favoring or opposing petitions during the hearings. This low engagement contrasted with the board's efficient handling of items, all passing without debate or dissent.</p>
        <p>The meeting wrapped with approvals for the 2026 board meeting schedule and the minutes from October 14, 2025, underscoring a forward-looking close to the year. These decisions collectively support Fall River's business landscape, from housing and hospitality to automotive and entertainment sectors, without any emergencies or contentious items emerging.</p>

        <h1 id="article-title">Fall River Council Clashes on Reforms, Hires, Equity</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="article-body">
                <p>### Fall River Council Tackles Charter Reforms, Appointments, and Equity Concerns in Marathon Session</p>
        <p>In a lengthy and at times heated Fall River City Council meeting, members delved into the city's governance blueprint, grappling with a special committee's recommendations on charter revisions while navigating contentious appointments and labor agreements. The session highlighted ongoing tensions over municipal operations, from employee equity to infrastructure management, as councilors debated how best to address litigation risks, staffing challenges, and public safety.</p>
        <p>The meeting kicked off with citizen input from Richard Branco, who criticized the current city charter as a "magic trick" that discourages public involvement rather than encouraging it. Drawing from his experience racing cars and interpreting rule books, Branco argued the charter creates an "exclusive club" that's hard for average residents to penetrate. He urged restarting the revision process, suggesting alternatives like electing a nine-member board from city wards. His comments set the stage for the council's review of the Special Charter Review Committee's report, which had been tabled from a previous session.</p>
        <p>The committee, chaired by Reena Brown and supported by clerk Tim Campos, presented recommendations aimed at refining the existing charter without a full rewrite. Key changes included overhauling recall provisions to require two separate elections—one to decide removal and another for replacement—to avoid past litigation pitfalls. They also addressed conflicts of interest, such as prohibiting city employees from holding elected positions like school committee seats, following a court ruling known as the "Hetsler clause." Other tweaks lowered signature requirements for ballot access from 150 to 100 and added clauses for vacating offices upon felony convictions related to official duties. The committee emphasized making the document more user-friendly by adding references to state laws and an index.</p>
        <p>Councilors engaged in extensive discussion, questioning aspects like cooling-off periods for former officials seeking city jobs, which the committee aligned with a one-year wait despite state ethics allowing six months. There was debate on whether contracts for department heads should require council re-approval upon renewal, with some arguing it ensures accountability, while corporation counsel Alan Rumsey clarified that the charter focuses on confirming individuals, not contract terms. The council ultimately accepted the report for filing and website posting, opting not to advance it immediately for legislative review or ballot placement, citing the need for further tweaks and alignment with upcoming elections.</p>
        <p>Appointments dominated much of the agenda, revealing procedural and equity concerns. The council confirmed Emily Arky as director of financial services on a one-year contract, with a stipulation for re-approval, amid debates over contract renewals needing council oversight. Christopher Murphy was unanimously confirmed as city auditor. However, the appointment of Christopher Pino as director of community maintenance sparked sharp debate. Councilors questioned Pino's qualifications, noting his brief prior tenure in city planning before leaving for another municipality, and raised issues about promoting from within versus external hires. Critics highlighted a pattern of training employees who then depart, only to return for promotions, potentially undermining internal morale. The council voted 6-3 to confirm Pino, with some expressing reservations about departmental performance under current leadership.</p>
        <p>Labor equity emerged as a flashpoint during discussions on a memorandum of agreement with the ASME union, covering about 200 employees including dispatchers. Councilors rejected the agreement 6-3, sending it back for revisions due to pay disparities between 911 dispatchers and those in the Mobile Integrated Health (MIH) program. Critics argued that MIH dispatchers, handling fewer calls (about 75 daily versus 250 for 911), receive higher pay despite similar roles, labeling it unfair and potentially inviting labor disputes. The council urged addressing this inequity, with some suggesting side agreements or memorandums of understanding to equalize rates, estimating an additional $100,000 cost for parity.</p>
        <p>Public safety and infrastructure also featured prominently. A resolution, co-sponsored by councilors, called for a traffic study at the William Street and Broadway intersection, identified as one of the region's most dangerous, following a pedestrian accident. The measure was amended to extend the study from Columbia Street to Middle Street, encompassing areas like Lafayette Park with high pedestrian traffic, and passed unanimously. Another resolution directed the finance committee to plan performance audits for city departments, aiming for one or two annually to enhance efficiency and accountability.</p>
        <p>The meeting underscored broader themes of governance reform and operational challenges. Councilors approved resolutions to review committee structures, potentially redefining the real estate committee to include housing and facilities oversight, reflecting a push for better addressing homelessness and development. They also sought evaluations of polling location changes amid declining voter turnout.</p>
        <p>Throughout, public participation was evident, with residents voicing charter concerns and safety issues, demonstrating community engagement. The session ended with approvals for various licenses, claims referrals, and drain layer permits, wrapping up a packed agenda focused on refining city operations and responding to resident needs.</p>

        <h1 id="article-title">Fall River Honors Herman Bombback with Memorial Bench</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="article-body">
                <p># Fall River Honors Herman Bombback: A Bench Dedication Reflects a Life of Community Service</p>
        <p>FALL RIVER — In a poignant ceremony at a local park, family, friends, veterans, and city officials gathered to dedicate a bench in memory of Herman Bombback, a longtime resident whose contributions to veterans' causes, youth sports, and local music left an indelible mark on the community. The event, organized by the American Legion Post 464, featured speeches, prayers, and symbolic gestures that highlighted Bombback's multifaceted legacy, drawing a crowd that underscored his wide-reaching influence.</p>
        <p>The ceremony began with acknowledgments from Lisa Borges, commander of American Legion Post 464, who thanked key participants including Mayor Paul Coogan, City Councilwoman Linda Pereira, Reverend Stinson, and various veterans' groups. Borges emphasized the collaborative effort behind the dedication, noting contributions from the parks department, the Vietnam Veterans of Fall River, and the bench committee, which had worked for nine months to make the project a reality. She described Bombback as someone who taught the value of collective effort, a theme that resonated throughout the proceedings.</p>
        <p>Following the opening remarks, an honor guard presented colors, and participants recited the Pledge of Allegiance. Reverend Stinson then led an invocation, invoking Bombback's spirit of service and praying for the bench to serve as a place of remembrance and hospitality. The family unveiled the bench, which features nameplates donated by Bill and Paula Dearis, symbolizing a spot for reflection and conversation—fitting for a man known for bringing people together.</p>
        <p>Speeches formed the core of the event, offering personal insights into Bombback's life. Coach Shaun Travis, who knew Bombback through baseball and as a family friend, recounted their shared history spanning over 40 years. Travis highlighted Bombback's roles as a coach, mentor, and founder of the Autumn Baseball League and the American Legion baseball team. He noted that the team captured the Massachusetts State Championship the previous summer, the first such win for Fall River in 35 years, and dedicated it to Bombback, whom he believed acted as a "guardian angel" during the season. Travis urged attendees to reflect on their own connections to Bombback, pointing out his ability to maintain lifelong friendships across diverse groups.</p>
        <p>Laura Bombback, Herman's widow, spoke on behalf of the family, expressing gratitude to organizers and donors. She painted a vivid picture of her husband's character, describing him as someone who excelled at gathering people, whether through community involvement, veterans' support, baseball, or music. Laura shared lesser-known anecdotes, such as Bombback's appointment as a justice of the peace in Swansea, where he officiated weddings, including offering his services to a paramedic while in the emergency room. She also recalled his final "gig" in the hospital, where he and a friend performed for staff and patients despite learning he had only two months to live. These stories illustrated Bombback's relentless positivity and desire to connect, even in his last days.</p>
        <p>City Councilwoman Linda Pereira added her perspective, recalling Bombback's dedication to veterans, his passion for coaching youth and adult sports leagues, and his enthusiasm for music, particularly playing bass guitar. Pereira addressed the family directly, acknowledging their pride in his accomplishments and the sorrow of his passing on July 4. She imagined Bombback continuing his organizing ways in the afterlife, a sentiment that captured the event's blend of mourning and celebration.</p>
        <p>Mayor Paul Coogan provided a brief but personal tribute, sharing memories of Bombback as a formidable athlete who "ran over" him during football games in their youth. Coogan, who has known the Bombback family his entire life in Fall River, praised Herman's positive attitude and community contributions, emphasizing the fun and impact of his presence.</p>
        <p>The ceremony concluded with symbolic elements that reinforced themes of remembrance and peace. Bill Dearis facilitated the release of white doves, described as symbols of love, hope, and peace, with attendees encouraged to send personal messages skyward. The Vietnam Veterans of Fall River Honor Guard played taps, followed by a closing prayer from Reverend Stinson, who asked for blessings on the bench and urged participants to emulate Bombback's example in pursuing good works.</p>
        <p>Throughout the event, public participation was evident, with family members, veterans, and community figures actively involved in the unveiling, speeches, and rituals. The gathering drew from various sectors of Fall River life—sports enthusiasts, military veterans, musicians, and local leaders—reflecting Bombback's broad network. No formal decisions or debates occurred, as this was a commemorative event rather than a policy meeting, but the dedication itself represents a lasting community outcome: a physical tribute installed by the Fall River Parks Commission to honor Bombback's service.</p>
        <p>Analytically, the ceremony reveals how individual legacies can unify diverse groups in a city like Fall River, where community ties often intersect through shared activities like sports and veterans' affairs. Bombback's story, as told through the speakers, demonstrates a pattern of sustained involvement—from founding sports leagues to supporting veterans—that fostered long-term relationships. The bench's placement in a public park ensures ongoing visibility, potentially inspiring future generations to engage similarly. Events like this also highlight the role of local organizations, such as the American Legion, in preserving history and promoting civic participation without formal governmental action.</p>
        <p>In a broader context, Fall River has seen numerous such dedications in recent years, often tied to veterans or community leaders, underscoring a municipal emphasis on honoring service amid ongoing discussions about park maintenance and public spaces. While no emergencies or urgent issues were raised here, the event aligns with the city's pattern of using commemorations to strengthen community bonds. Attendees left with a sense of closure, but also a reminder of Bombback's enduring influence, as the bench now stands as a quiet invitation for reflection in the heart of the park.</p>

        <h1 id="article-title">Fall River Honors Trans Lives Amid Rising Threats</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="article-body">
                <p># Fall River's Transgender Day of Remembrance Highlights Personal Struggles and Global Challenges</p>
        <p>FALL RIVER — In a poignant gathering at City Hall, community members came together for the annual Transgender Day of Remembrance, sharing raw personal stories, confronting societal prejudices, and honoring those lost to violence. The event, organized by the Fall River Pride Committee, drew speakers who detailed experiences of discrimination, threats, and the ongoing fight for acceptance, culminating in a memorial reading of names of trans individuals murdered in the past year.</p>
        <p>The evening featured multiple speakers, each offering insights into the lived realities of trans, non-binary, and gender non-conforming people. Sean Connell, identifying as trans, non-binary, and gender non-conforming, opened with a powerful address rooted in their deep ties to Fall River. Born and raised in the city, Connell described receiving death threats while preparing for the event, underscoring the persistent hostility faced by queer individuals. They highlighted global disparities, noting that around 70 countries still criminalize or execute queer people, compared to about 30 that allow same-sex marriage. Connell emphasized that queer visibility, such as on television, often meets resistance, yet it's essential for countering isolation and high suicide rates among the community—rates they said are two to five times higher due to stigma and shame.</p>
        <p>Connell's speech wove in historical context, pointing out that queer people have been sexualized, punished, and outlawed for centuries. They challenged accusations of "sexualizing children," arguing that such claims stem from centuries-old prejudices rather than reality. Drawing from personal history, Connell shared their journey as an agender person, discovering the term during high school research on transgender rights. They recounted a coming-out story to their mother, marked by a lighthearted moment referencing a cartoon character, which helped ease the tension. This narrative illustrated the importance of safe spaces, like LGBTQ+ after-school programs, for youth navigating identity.</p>
        <p>Another speaker, who shared a poem written at age 14, reflected on their transition journey. Identifying as a trans man, they discussed milestones like starting testosterone and receiving a binder, framing these as steps toward authenticity. The poem, reread from their first appearance at the event years prior, vividly captured feelings of dysphoria and societal expectations around gender. Lines like "I am a boy born into this form that I do not own" and aspirations for a body that aligns with their identity highlighted the internal conflicts many trans individuals face. The speaker noted societal pressures from a young age, such as gendered toys, and longed for freedom from those constraints.</p>
        <p>The event also addressed misinformation and violence head-on. Speakers referenced local incidents, such as a drag queen story time falsely accused of involving drugs and pornography, illustrating the "lies and rumor-making" that fuel hatred. They pointed to the murders of dozens of trans people in the U.S. alone over the past year, questioning how memorializing victims could be labeled "evil" while perpetrators escape scrutiny. One speaker challenged comparisons to religious proselytizing, noting that queer communities aren't pushing agendas door-to-door but are instead accused of "shoving" their identities onto others.</p>
        <p>A trans woman from a prominent New England drag family provided historical background on the Day of Remembrance itself. She explained that it originated 26 years ago in Boston, just 58 miles away, sparked by the murder of a trans woman and organized by a transgender advocate and allies. As a lifelong New Englander who came out at 38, she shared her daily life—flying a trans flag outside her home and defiantly living authentically despite challenges. Her message was one of inclusivity: trans people simply want to "live their life, go to work, and be a person," deserving the same respect as anyone else.</p>
        <p>Public participation was evident throughout, with applause punctuating speeches and a collective moment of silence. The event fostered engagement, as speakers encouraged outreach to the Fall River Pride Committee for support, emphasizing resources for gender-affirming care and community connection. Issues discussed ranged from access to healthcare that "saves lives" to combating online hate on platforms like Facebook, where speakers advised selective engagement to support sidelined individuals without exhausting oneself.</p>
        <p>The climax came with the reading of names by Rachel Lumis, secretary of the Pride Committee. The list, focused on U.S. victims from the past 12 months, included over 50 individuals such as Anie Walker, Megan Jordan, and others, many identified by chosen names. Speakers noted this was just a fraction of global losses, with a full list available online. The names were read against a backdrop of displayed memorials, leading to a flag-raising at half-mast outside City Hall. The trans flag would fly for the week, accompanied by lights and an art exhibit, symbolizing ongoing remembrance.</p>
        <p>Connell, who also closed the event, reiterated the need for equal rights, not special treatment. They compared gender-affirming care to cosmetic procedures like hair plugs or nose jobs, arguing for bodily autonomy. The gathering didn't involve formal decisions but served as a platform for advocacy, urging society to unpack biases that lead to violence. Speakers stressed that trans and queer existence challenges binaries and patriarchy, backed by science showing gender and sex as spectrums, with historical evidence dating back 10,000 years.</p>
        <p>No emergencies were mentioned, but the event highlighted the urgency of addressing rising threats, with speakers sharing personal encounters like death threats from local connections. This local engagement, from lifelong residents to youth, showed a community actively confronting these issues. The Fall River Pride Committee has hosted similar events for four years, evolving from a cold riverside walk to an indoor memorial, reflecting growing participation and commitment to visibility.</p>
        <p>In analyzing the speeches, patterns emerge: personal narratives as tools for education, historical and global contexts to frame current struggles, and a call for empathy over division. The event underscores how remembrance intersects with advocacy, providing a space where stories of resilience counter narratives of hate. As Fall River continues these commemorations, they offer a lens into broader societal shifts toward inclusion.</p>

        <h1 id="article-title">Surprise Tribute Honors Fall River's 52-Year Club Icon</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="article-body">
                <p># Surprise Tribute Shines Light on a Lifetime of Quiet Impact at Fall River's Boys and Girls Club</p>
        <p>In a heartfelt twist that caught everyone off guard, what was billed as an event to honor someone else turned into a celebration of John Sulio's remarkable 52 years of service at the Boys and Girls Club in Fall River. Gathered in the club's familiar halls, community leaders, family, and friends pulled off a surprise that highlighted Sulio's enduring role in shaping young lives, complete with speeches, awards, and reflections on his contributions.</p>
        <p>The event kicked off with a playful ruse, as the initial announcement suggested the gathering was for Lenny Sylvia. But quickly, the focus shifted to Sulio, who's been a fixture at the club for nearly four decades—actually, closer to five if you count his early days as a member. Born in 1959, Sulio was there for the building's dedication in 1967, even recalling Senator Ted Kennedy as a speaker. He joined as a kid, paying his modest dues, and by his sophomore year in high school, he was working part-time, handling coats and sports gear. After graduating at 16, he dove in full-time under mentor Al Carrera, eventually influencing thousands of youngsters through programs and personal guidance.</p>
        <p>One speaker after another stepped up to share how Sulio's work rippled through the community. Vic Pereira, introduced as "Mr. Mayor or Vic," spoke first, crediting Sulio with changing his life during his youth. "I would not be here today without John's influences," Pereira said, emphasizing that Sulio essentially embodies the Boys and Girls Club. The room filled with laughter and applause as stories unfolded, painting a picture of Sulio as a mentor who traded street hockey for basketball courts, steering kids like Pereira toward positive paths. Pereira went on to become a notable player and educator, a testament to those early nudges.</p>
        <p>The ceremony's organizer delved into Sulio's backstory, noting his excellence in graphic arts and track at Diamond High School, and his progression from part-time helper to full-time staffer by age 18. A key anecdote involved Sulio convincing neighborhood kids, including Pereira, to join the club and learn basketball, which not only built skills but fostered lifelong connections. For these efforts, Sulio received the Fall River Icon Award, presented as a custom-engraved bat from Louis Loo and Axis Bat Company. "Congratulations, John. This bat's for you—a Fall River icon for 52 years of service," the presenter declared amid cheers.</p>
        <p>Sulio, visibly moved and unprepared, took the mic to express his gratitude. "I had no idea that this was going to happen," he admitted, thanking the staff, members, and everyone present. He reflected on the overwhelming positive impact he'd made, saying, "It just overwhelms me to think that I could have such a positive impact, but I did. And I love the kids as well as the staff." His words underscored a career built on genuine connections, not grand gestures.</p>
        <p>The event drew notable figures, adding layers to the tribute. New city councilor Mike came forward, sharing how he knew Sulio through Holy Name Church and praising his community involvement. State Representative Carol Fiola and Senator Mike Rogers also spoke, presenting a citation that lauded Sulio's incredible influence. Fiola highlighted how kids everywhere recognize him—"Hi John, hi John"—and noted the club's role as his second home. Rogers, a longtime friend, recalled Sulio's smiling face during his visits and pointed out the broader community benefits, including how former club kids now give back as adults. Rogers even mentioned his grandson joining the club just the night before, illustrating the generational continuity Sulio helped foster.</p>
        <p>Family members chimed in too, with Sulio's sibling—the "baby of the bunch"—thanking organizers and acknowledging the community's support. "We as his family would also like to recognize the community, the Boys and Girls Club, the city that has wrapped their arms around John and stood by him through his journey," they said, emphasizing mutual appreciation.</p>
        <p>An impromptu interview afterward revealed more about Sulio's approach. When asked about encountering former club kids as adults, he described it as "truly unbelievable," noting how they approach him eagerly, often with their own children or grandchildren in tow. On the rewards of the job, which isn't lucrative, Sulio explained, "What I do not get in financial money, I make up tenfold in my heart—the good feeling that I know I made a difference." He shared tactics like letting shy kids win at ping-pong to build confidence, aiming simply to "make connections."</p>
        <p>Sulio hoped those he mentored would carry forward lessons of love, laughter, and joy, becoming examples themselves. Addressing Fall River's challenges, like poverty and absent father figures, he confirmed stepping into mentor roles, finding it "humbling and rewarding" to make even a small difference. "I had a little say. I'm not saying I did everything, but I helped as many as I could," he said.</p>
        <p>This gathering wasn't just a pat on the back; it spotlighted how one person's steady presence can anchor a community institution. The Boys and Girls Club, a vital resource in Fall River since its 1967 dedication, relies on figures like Sulio to provide safe spaces and guidance amid local issues like economic hardship. Public participation was evident, with attendees from various walks—politicians, family, staff, and former members—showing broad engagement. No formal decisions emerged, as this was a celebratory event rather than a policy meeting, but the tributes reinforced the club's ongoing importance.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, the event implies continued support for such programs, with speakers hinting at the need to sustain places that nurture youth. Sulio's story reminds us how individual commitments accumulate into lasting community strength, without fanfare or agenda—just consistent effort over decades.</p>

        <h1 id="article-title">Fall River Board Greenlights Business Revamps and Renewals</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="article-body">
                <p># Fall River Licensing Board Approves Key Business Changes and Renewals Amid Community Shifts</p>
        <p>FALL RIVER — In a routine yet impactful session, the Fall River Licensing Board tackled a slate of license approvals, transfers, and renewals that reflect ongoing changes in the city's business landscape, from lodging houses to restaurants and auto sales operations.</p>
        <p>The meeting kicked off with the approval of a lodging house license for the Fall River Community Housing Resource Board at 202 Rock Street. Board Chairman Gregory Brian clarified that this was for the existing setup, not an expansion, as the property had recently changed hands from previous owner Thomas Pastinac. Applicant Stacy Demora explained the transition, noting that Pastinac had renewed his license while the board applied for theirs, effectively changing the operation's name. No one spoke in favor or opposition, and the board unanimously approved the petition after a brief discussion confirming inspections weren't yet needed for any new units.</p>
        <p>Next up was The Liberal Club at 20 Star Street, where Paul L. DeForge Jr. sought changes to officers, directors, LLC managers, and a one-time extension of hours for three dates: Thanksgiving Eve (November 26), New Year's Eve (December 31), and Super Bowl Sunday (February 8), all until 1 a.m. DeForge confirmed these extensions aligned with past approvals without issues, and police reports showed no concerns. The board approved the changes unanimously, with no public input.</p>
        <p>A similar set of updates came for Tequila Lime Cantina, involving a change of manager to Nicholas Ozog, along with shifts in officers, directors, LLC managers, stock issuance, and a new stockholder. Represented by Attorney Cheryl Bernard, Ozog highlighted his 20 years in the liquor business and ownership of another local spot, the Brew House District. The operation would remain unchanged, and police clearance was already in place. Again, no public comments, and the board granted approval.</p>
        <p>The Fall River Sports Club at 233 Hope Street followed, with Jan El Rigo applying for changes in manager (himself), officers, directors, and LLC managers to align paperwork with state requirements. Rigo shared his bartending background and plans to inject new energy into the aging club, committing to 30-40 hours weekly on-site. The police had no objections, and the board approved without dissent.</p>
        <p>License transfers highlighted evolving dining options in the city. TTC Entertainment LLC, represented by Tan New Y and Attorney Hong Tran, took over 1019 South Main Street—formerly Patty's Pub—to launch a pho and ramen restaurant. New Y described minimal interior changes and hours from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. weekdays, extending to 1 a.m. on weekends. He noted his chef's 16 years of experience, though he himself was new to restaurant management. Police approved, and the transfer passed unanimously.</p>
        <p>Another transfer went to JNMN LLC at 347-351 Alden Street for the Modern Snack Bar. Attorney David Assad explained that Joel Msia, who owns another eatery on Rhode Island Avenue, would maintain current operations and hours (varying from 6 a.m. to 2 a.m. on weekends, with alcohol restrictions noted for Sundays). Police had no issues, and the board approved, emphasizing Msia's on-site presence of about 35 hours weekly.</p>
        <p>The bulk of the agenda focused on 2026 renewals across categories. Dozens of common victualler licenses were renewed for establishments like Dunkin' Donuts locations, McDonald's outlets, and local spots such as Nick's Hot Dogs and Europa Pastries. These renewals ensure continuity for a wide array of eateries, from fast food to specialty cafes, without any noted objections or discussions.</p>
        <p>Class one, two, and three auto sales licenses saw renewals for over 50 businesses, including Empire Ford, Mattie's Diesel Service, and various independent dealers like Joe's Gas and Auto Sales. These approvals maintain the city's robust auto sector, with no public challenges raised.</p>
        <p>Fortune teller licenses were renewed for three operations: Liu Ken Holdings at 1554 Pleasant Street, Sally's Palm Reading at 1022 South Main Street, and Psychic Readings by Taylor at 121 Brighton Avenue. Lodging house renewals included spots like 202 Rock Street (under Pastinac, separate from the earlier approval), Park Rooms at 517 South Main Street, and several under Raldi Peace Operations LLC.</p>
        <p>Under old business, the board revisited Grand Motors LLC's request for a new location at 104 Anawan Street. Owner James Sylvester presented an updated lease with 325 square feet of office space and 24 parking spots, addressing prior concerns. The class two wholesale license was approved unanimously, with police clearance confirmed.</p>
        <p>The meeting also set the 2026 board schedule and approved prior minutes, wrapping up without notable public participation beyond applicants. While no emergencies were discussed, the extensions for The Liberal Club point to anticipated high-traffic events like holidays and the Super Bowl, allowing extended service hours to accommodate community gatherings.</p>
        <p>Overall, the decisions underscore Fall River's adaptive business environment, with transfers signaling fresh culinary ventures and renewals stabilizing established operations. Public engagement was minimal, limited to applicants explaining their plans, but the unanimous approvals suggest broad alignment on these local economic shifts. As the city heads into the new year, these moves could influence everything from dining diversity to housing options, keeping the board's role central in managing growth.</p>

        <h1 id="article-title">Fall River Council Clashes on Charter Reforms, Appointments, Safety</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="article-body">
                <p>### Fall River City Council Tackles Charter Reforms, Appointments, and Safety Concerns in Marathon Session</p>
        <p>In a lengthy and at times contentious meeting, the Fall River City Council delved into a wide array of local governance issues, from proposed charter revisions to key administrative appointments and public safety enhancements. The session highlighted ongoing debates about the city's foundational rules, departmental leadership, and community priorities, reflecting the council's efforts to address both immediate concerns and long-term structural changes.</p>
        <p>The meeting kicked off with citizen input from Richard Branco, who voiced strong criticisms of the city's new charter. Drawing from his experience in racing and rule interpretation, Branco argued that the charter acts more like a "rule book" that's been exploited through loopholes, failing to encourage broader public involvement in local politics. He compared it to a "magic trick" that creates an exclusive club, making it harder for average residents to participate. Branco urged the council to scrap the current charter and start fresh, even suggesting an election-based nine-member board aligned with city wards. His comments set the stage for the council's deeper dive into charter matters.</p>
        <p>A significant portion of the discussion centered on the report from the Special Charter Review Committee, presented by Chairperson Reena Brown and Clerk Tim Campos. The committee, which worked for over two years, proposed several amendments to address past litigation and improve operations. Key changes included revising recall provisions to involve two separate elections—one to vote on removal and another for replacement if needed—after consulting with elections chair Ryan Lyons to ensure feasibility. They also tackled the "Hetsler clause," removing prohibitions on city employees seeking certain elected positions following a court ruling that deemed it unconstitutional. Other updates lowered the signature requirement for ballot access from 150 to 100, added language on felony convictions vacating offices if related to job duties, and referenced state laws for ethics and other standards to make the document more user-friendly.</p>
        <p>Councilors engaged in extensive questioning, probing details like cooling-off periods for former officials taking compensated city positions (set at one year in the proposal, contrasting with the state's six months) and whether contract renewals require reconfirmation. Debates arose over equity in pay scales, particularly for dispatchers, and the need for clarity on issues like department head contracts expiring without automatic reapproval. The committee emphasized that their recommendations are not a full rewrite but fixes to existing problems, and the process involves council and mayoral approval before submission to the Attorney General for legal review and eventual ballot placement, potentially in 2027 for better visibility. Ultimately, the council voted to accept the report and post it on the city website, signaling a step toward further review without immediate adoption.</p>
        <p>Appointments sparked some of the meeting's most heated exchanges. The council confirmed Emily Arky as Director of Financial Services but with a condition: a one-year contract requiring reconfirmation, stemming from debates on whether contract renewals necessitate council approval. This led to broader discussions on charter interpretations, with Corporation Counsel Alan Rumsey advising that the charter focuses on confirming individuals' qualifications, not ongoing contract terms, treating employment as continuous. The confirmation passed 6-3 after motions to amend and clarify.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the appointment of Christopher Pino as Director of Community Maintenance faced significant scrutiny and was rejected 6-3. Councilors questioned Pino's experience, noting his prior city roles in cemeteries and planning before leaving for another municipality and returning. Debates touched on internal promotions, training investments, and departmental performance under current leadership, with Director of City Operations Al Oliveira defending Pino's administrative skills and potential to alleviate workload. The rejection highlighted concerns over continuity and qualifications in key positions.</p>
        <p>The council unanimously confirmed Christopher Murphy as City Auditor and reappointed Kristen Cantara Oliveira to the Preservation Committee without major debate.</p>
        <p>Labor issues also took center stage, with the council rejecting a memorandum of agreement with ASME Council 93 Local 3177 by a 7-2 vote, sending it back for revisions. Discussions in the finance committee focused on pay inequities, particularly between dispatchers in the police/fire departments and those in the MIH (Mobile Integrated Health) unit, where MIH dispatchers earn more despite similar roles and lower call volumes. Councilors emphasized the need for fairness, retention challenges, and alignment with state standards, prompting the rejection to address these disparities.</p>
        <p>On infrastructure and safety, the council approved loan orders for water system improvements totaling $8.9 million after amendments, and advanced an intermunicipal agreement for water services with Westport to the finance committee. They also passed resolutions calling for a traffic study at the dangerous William Street and Broadway intersection (expanded to include Columbia to Middle Street) and initiating performance audits of city departments to enhance efficiency and accountability.</p>
        <p>The session underscored Fall River's push for governance reforms amid resident concerns, with charter discussions revealing tensions over accessibility and legal nuances. While some appointments advanced with conditions, others stalled, pointing to ongoing scrutiny of leadership and processes. The council's actions reflect a balance between immediate administrative needs and broader calls for transparency and equity, setting the stage for future committee work on these fronts.</p>

        <h1 id="article-title">Fall River Parks Prioritize Maintenance Over New Builds</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="article-body">
                <p>### Fall River Park Board Weighs In on Father Kelly Park Upgrades Amid Broader Push for Maintenance and Planning</p>
        <p>In a focused session on November 24, the Fall River Park Board of Commissioners tackled several park-related requests, with the spotlight falling on a proposal for improvements at Father Kelly Park. The meeting highlighted ongoing efforts to align park enhancements with community needs identified in the city's recently developed open space and recreation plan, revealing a strategic shift toward maintenance over new builds.</p>
        <p>The board first addressed two tree removal requests. Commissioners approved the removal of a tree at 160 C Street after confirmation from parks staff that it was necessary, following an inspection by the tree warden. Similarly, they greenlit the removal of a dead tree at 73 Grove Street, emphasizing the need to address hazardous conditions promptly.</p>
        <p>The core of the discussion centered on a presentation by Dan Aguar, director of engineering and planning for the city. Aguar outlined a proposal to submit to the Community Preservation Committee (CPC) for funding improvements at Father Kelly Park, including off-street parking, updated landscaping, lighting, seating areas, and picnic facilities. This initiative stems from feedback gathered over two years through public outreach, meetings, and online surveys as part of the open space and recreation plan, which identified key citizen priorities like safety, lighting, parking, and amenities. Aguar noted that the plan, developed with input from various stakeholders including SRPEDD, calls for a 10-year framework of "shovel-ready" projects to avoid scrambling for funds. He stressed the importance of consistent requests to CPC, such as annual installations of uniform benches across parks.</p>
        <p>Aguar explained that the Father Kelly Park proposal addresses specific complaints about parking shortages during high-usage events like softball tournaments. The park sees intense activity sporadically, and the suggested improvements aim to integrate a small parking facility in a minimally intrusive area. He presented a conceptual sketch, clarifying it's not final and would incorporate board input, surveys, and tree assessments before any design is set in stone. The request seeks about $500,000 from CPC, with potential city contributions to offset costs, and could be phased based on funding outcomes. Aguar has already secured letters of support from local officials, including State Representative Alan Sylvia and several city councilors, and emphasized that the park board's endorsement would be pivotal for the CPC application due early December.</p>
        <p>Commissioners engaged deeply with the proposal, probing its implications. One raised concerns about maximizing parking spaces to alleviate street congestion, cautioning against underutilizing the space with too few spots. Aguar acknowledged the balancing act between preserving park aesthetics—respecting existing walkways and trees—and functional needs, noting that final designs would depend on funding and board preferences. Discussions also touched on enforcement challenges, such as preventing overnight parking or misuse, drawing parallels to issues at other sites like Maplewood Park. Ideas floated included signage, potential paid parking kiosks to generate maintenance revenue, and broader strategies like branding or dedicated funding streams.</p>
        <p>The conversation expanded to systemic park issues, with Aguar and commissioners analyzing the city's pattern of building impressive facilities without adequate maintenance budgets. Aguar pointed out that Fall River excels at new constructions—like schools and parks—but lacks mechanisms for upkeep, from painting to grass cutting. He advocated prioritizing improvements to existing assets over expansions, citing examples like redirecting funds from ambitious projects such as a $5 million Kennedy Park overlook to basics like lighting and playgrounds. Commissioners echoed this, discussing underused spaces in parks like Pulaski and Maplewood, where outdated amenities like multiple baseball fields no longer align with current demands, such as soccer or football leagues seeking venues.</p>
        <p>Public participation was minimal, with no citizens signed up for input, though Aguar referenced broader engagement in the open space plan, including surveys with 584 respondents highlighting needs like bathrooms, lighting, and safety. He lamented low turnout at public hearings, noting only four residents attended one major event, yet stressed the value of that feedback. Commissioners suggested involving local groups, like softball leagues, for targeted input on Father Kelly Park.</p>
        <p>On the recreation plan itself, Aguar described it as a required 10-year document (2025-2035) that inventories amenities, maps them via GIS for public access (e.g., locating pickleball courts), and sets goals like forming an oversight committee to monitor progress. Key takeaways include pushing for proper funding, reinstating a tree commission, and increasing environmental police to five officers for enforcement against issues like illegal dumping and camping. Commissioners expressed interest in collaborating with Aguar and parks staff to refine park usage, shifting focus from routine approvals like tree removals to strategic planning.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the board voted unanimously to provide a letter of support for the Father Kelly Park proposal to CPC, conditional on their final approval of designs. This move underscores a collaborative approach, positioning the board as a key player in shaping outcomes. No emergencies were noted, but the meeting underscored the urgency of the CPC deadline, prompting this session ahead of the regular schedule.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, the board discussed capital planning, with parks staff aiming for a $3.5 million budget focused on maintenance—a significant jump from last year's $180,000—aligning with plan goals. Commissioners skipped a December meeting, opting to reconvene in January to continue these dialogues.</p>
        <p>This meeting illustrates how Fall River's park governance is evolving, using data-driven plans to address longstanding gaps in funding and maintenance while responding to community-driven priorities. As discussions progress, the emphasis on enforcement, public input, and strategic funding could shape the city's open spaces for years to come.</p>

    </header>
    <div class="article-body">
                <p># For River Planning Board Greenlights Lot Merger for Major Apartment Conversion</p>
        <p>In the latest move to reshape urban housing in For River, the Planning Board has approved a key land plan that paves the way for transforming an existing structure at 37 Pox Street into 68 apartments. This decision, made during their November 24, 2025, meeting, resolves a previously tabled application and highlights the ongoing push to consolidate properties for denser residential development in the city's core.</p>
        <p>The application in question came from 37 Pox Street Partners LLC, seeking endorsement of what's known as an ANR plan—short for "Approval Not Required." These plans allow for certain land divisions or mergers without full subdivision approval, provided they meet specific criteria like maintaining adequate frontage and access. In this case, the goal was straightforward: combining three adjacent lots—identified on the assessor's map as G-6 parcels 0024, 0028, and 0029—into a single parcel. This merger is a critical step for the property owners, who had already secured a variance and special permit from the board earlier to convert the building into multifamily housing.</p>
        <p>What makes this approval noteworthy is its backstory. The board had put the brakes on the plan during their previous meeting on November 19, requesting tweaks to the recording information, specifically the book and page references for legal documents. These details might sound minor, but they're essential for ensuring the plan's accuracy when it's filed with the registry of deeds. Without them spot-on, you could end up with disputes down the line over property boundaries or ownership history. The applicants came back with the corrections, including updated references and excerpts from relevant deeds, which satisfied the board's concerns.</p>
        <p>Chris Lev, the assistant planner, laid out the rationale during the discussion. He explained that the plan's primary aim is to unify the lots, setting the stage for the apartment project. This isn't just about redrawing lines on a map; it's tied to a broader variance and special permit that allow for the conversion of what was likely an older or underutilized building into much-needed housing units. For River has seen a surge in such conversions lately, as developers look to repurpose existing structures amid rising demand for affordable apartments. The 68 units here could add significant inventory to the local market, potentially easing some pressure on rental prices, though that's dependent on how the project unfolds.</p>
        <p>Board members didn't delve into lengthy debate this time around—perhaps because the fixes were straightforward. Mike Faras kicked things off with a motion to accept the plan and its recording details as presented. Beth Andre seconded it, and with John Ferrer also voting in favor, the approval passed unanimously among those present. It's worth noting that not all members were there; Glory Pico and Mario Luciola were absent, but the quorum was sufficient to proceed. This quick resolution underscores how procedural hiccups, once addressed, can keep development momentum going without unnecessary delays.</p>
        <p>Public participation? There wasn't any this time. The board's policy allows for citizen input on planning matters at the end of meetings, with a signup sheet available for anyone wanting to chime in. No one stepped up, which isn't unusual for a targeted item like this one. But it does raise questions about community awareness— is this project flying under the radar, or are residents generally on board with more housing options? In past meetings, we've seen vocal turnout on bigger rezoning issues, so the silence here might simply reflect that this is more of a technical step than a controversial overhaul.</p>
        <p>Analytically speaking, this decision fits into a pattern we've observed in For River's planning landscape. The city has been grappling with housing shortages, and approvals like this one for lot mergers and conversions are tools to increase density without sprawling outward. By combining lots, developers can often navigate zoning requirements more easily, especially in areas zoned for mixed or residential use. The property at 37 Pox Street sits in what appears to be a transitional neighborhood, based on the assessor's map references—close enough to downtown amenities to make apartments appealing, but perhaps in need of revitalization. The variance and special permit already granted suggest the board weighed factors like parking, traffic impact, and building height, though those details weren't revisited in this session.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, what does this mean for the timeline? With the ANR plan endorsed, the applicants can now file it officially, which typically clears the path for construction permits. Assuming no appeals or further variances are needed, we could see shovels in the ground sooner rather than later. It's a reminder of how these behind-the-scenes approvals accumulate to shape the city's skyline— or in this case, its housing stock. For residents keeping an eye on neighborhood changes, this project at 37 Pox Street could bring new neighbors and possibly some economic ripple effects, like increased foot traffic for local businesses.</p>
        <p>That said, it's not without potential downsides that merit scrutiny. Merging lots can sometimes lead to larger developments that alter a block's character, and while the board's oversight aims to mitigate that, the lack of public comment means any lingering concerns might surface later. Analytically, this points to the importance of transparency in planning processes— ensuring that notices reach a wide audience so input isn't limited to insiders.</p>
        <p>Overall, this meeting's outcome reinforces For River's commitment to adaptive reuse of properties, turning what might have been vacant or single-use spaces into vibrant residential hubs. As the board adjourned without further business, it wrapped up a concise session focused on progress. If you're tracking development in the area, keep an eye on 37 Pox Street; it's one more piece in the puzzle of the city's evolving urban fabric.</p>

        <h1 id="article-title">Fall River Authority Advances Infrastructure, Events, Urban Renewal</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="article-body">
                <p># Fall River Redevelopment Authority Charts Course on Infrastructure, Events, and Urban Renewal</p>
        <p>In its November 20, 2025 meeting, the Fall River Redevelopment Authority tackled a range of ongoing projects, from infrastructure repairs to event planning and urban development strategies, revealing the interconnected challenges of maintaining public spaces while fostering economic growth. Board members, including Chair John Ericson, Ron Rousen, Ben Fidleberg, Joan Maderas, and Kee, along with staff like Executive Director Sarah Page and Project Manager Karen Martin, discussed updates and made decisions that could shape the city's waterfront and neighborhoods in the coming months.</p>
        <p>One key focus was the 2024 audit, where Martin provided an update on delays. She explained that the audit's finalization hinges on the Public Employee Retirement Administration Commission (PERAC) report, which won't be ready until February 2026. This report is essential for incorporating retirement numbers into the authority's audit. Martin noted she's reviewing a draft from CLA and hasn't identified any major issues yet, but the timeline means the full audit remains pending. This delay underscores the bureaucratic layers involved in financial oversight for public entities like the authority.</p>
        <p>Shifting to infrastructure, the board heard progress on cathodic protection work at the bulkhead. Martin reported that change order work, involving coding in the upper zones, is nearly complete, with a final inspection scheduled soon using a boat for access. She anticipates wrapping up with a final requisition and release of retainage by the next meeting, effectively closing out the project for winter. This step is crucial for protecting the waterfront structures from corrosion, a persistent issue in coastal environments.</p>
        <p>The North Watuppa Pond revetment project also advanced, with Martin detailing ongoing stonework. Favorable tides have allowed the contractor to place toe stones ahead of schedule, stabilizing the slope. A meeting with engineers was set to approve a sample section of the finished product. Martin projected completion by mid-December, emphasizing the need for finesse in placement to ensure long-term durability. Additionally, a $125,000 earmark from the Executive Office of Economic Development, secured by Representative Fiola, has been funded. The board voted unanimously to authorize the chair to sign related contract documents, allocating these funds toward the revetment. This decision highlights how state earmarks are bolstering local infrastructure efforts.</p>
        <p>Event planning at City Pier emerged as a substantive discussion, centering on a draft application for private events. Martin outlined the document, which includes rental rates and insurance requirements, and noted the need for a Chapter 91 license amendment to allow private uses beyond public events. Beta Group proposed $4,500 to handle submissions to MassDEP for amendments covering a specific South Coast event in June and general private events. The board approved this amendment unanimously, authorizing the chair to sign it for a cost not exceeding $4,500.</p>
        <p>Board members delved into operational details, debating the number of private events to permit annually to avoid excessive wear on the pier's green spaces. Suggestions included a maximum of 10 per year, with no more than two per month during peak season (May through October), to balance revenue with maintenance costs. They emphasized flexibility, noting that actual approvals would depend on MassDEP conditions and internal assessments of damage from foot traffic, setups, and weather. Fees were another point: the draft sets nonprofit rates at $2,000 per day, prompting discussion on whether setup days for events like the South Coast one—potentially spanning four days—should be discounted, given partial public access during preparations. No final changes were made, but the conversation reflected concerns about fairness and the potential chilling effect on event organizers. Security and cleanup responsibilities would fall to applicants, with walkways remaining open.</p>
        <p>On urban renewal, Page updated the board on state-level regulatory changes aimed at accelerating housing development and simplifying environmental reviews for urban renewal plans. Comments were submitted in collaboration with MassINC and others, including supportive letters from mayors like Fall River's Paul Coogan. However, ongoing processes mean the authority's Pleasant Street plan will likely require a special review procedure under MEPA, rather than benefiting immediately from streamlined rules. Decisions are expected in December, potentially delaying the plan's advancement until January. Page also discussed an application to designate the Pleasant Street corridor in the Flint neighborhood as a Transformative Development Initiative (TDI) district, similar to past downtown efforts. Partners include Health First Family Care Center, offering space and support, and local entities like Espirito Santo School. The proposal commits significant staff time—30 to 40 hours monthly from Page and Martin—to implementation, valued as an in-kind contribution. While competitive, with only six districts funded statewide, the effort has rallied diverse stakeholders, potentially yielding long-term benefits even if unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>In the North Main Downtown District, dubbed NMA, Page highlighted a successful "Thanksmiss" event on Purchase Street, featuring tents, food trucks, kids' activities, and open restaurants, creating a festive atmosphere despite the chill. Feedback noted lighting issues for vendors as dusk fell, a detail for future events. Business updates included the sale of BunBuds to an experienced operator, the opening of a cheese and meats popup store (with hopes of adding retail wine sales), and the transformation of Viva Fall River into a vintage clothing shop set for Black Friday. These developments signal evolving retail dynamics in the area. A steering committee meeting was planned for December 8, including a site visit with Liberty Utilities and a discussion with the police chief on district safety. The next full meeting is January 14.</p>
        <p>Public participation was evident through staff reports on community involvement, such as partner commitments in the TDI application and event attendance, showing local engagement in revitalization efforts. The meeting adjourned to executive session to discuss real estate strategies for properties on Anawan Street, Davol Street, and Innovation Way, with no return to open session.</p>
        <p>This session illustrated the authority's balancing act: advancing repairs and funding while navigating regulatory hurdles and community needs. With audits delayed, projects progressing, and urban plans in flux, the coming months will test these decisions' impact on Fall River's landscape.</p>

        <h1 id="article-title">Fall River Zoning Drama: Denials, Approvals Amid Parking Battles</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="article-body">
                <p>### Fall River Zoning Board Navigates Complex Petitions on Housing, Business, and Land Use</p>
        <p>In a marathon session that stretched into the evening, the Fall River Zoning Board of Appeals delved into a slate of petitions ranging from educational facilities to residential developments and business reinstatements. The November 20, 2025, meeting highlighted the board's role in balancing local zoning laws with practical needs, as petitioners sought variances and special permits to adapt properties amid evolving state regulations and community concerns. Key discussions centered on parking challenges, historical uses, and innovative housing solutions, with outcomes reflecting careful scrutiny of legal precedents and neighborhood impacts.</p>
        <p>The evening kicked off with unresolved old business involving Little Hands College Incorporated at 551 Rock Street. Attorney David Assad represented the petitioner, arguing for a special permit to waive parking requirements and erect a business-identifying sign for an early education facility. The debate hinged on the Dover Amendment, a state law exempting educational and religious uses from certain local zoning restrictions. Assad cited guidance from Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell, asserting that the amendment prohibits municipalities from requiring special permits for such uses, as it would introduce discretionary interference. He emphasized that early education serves the public good, supported by state policy in Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 15D, and pointed to ample on-street parking along Rock Street—estimating 62 spaces available against a maximum need of 20.</p>
        <p>Board members, including Chairman Joseph Pereira, acknowledged the educational use but raised concerns about neighborhood impacts, particularly parking for up to 19 employees. Neighbors like William Brown and Connie Silver voiced opposition, highlighting traffic congestion from nearby schools and businesses, safety risks for pedestrians, and strain on residential parking. Brown disputed the parking estimates, claiming only about 40 spaces after accounting for hydrants and driveways. Silver described daily gridlock and personal burdens, such as carrying groceries across busy streets. Alex Silva added worries about child safety during drop-offs and pickups, especially in winter conditions.</p>
        <p>The board ultimately denied both requests. For parking relief, the vote was unanimous to deny, citing insufficient off-street options and detriment to the public good. The sign request failed 3-2, with Pereira and member Jim Caulkins voting in favor but the majority prevailing against it. The decision leaves the facility's operations in limbo, potentially leading to further legal action under the Dover Amendment.</p>
        <p>Shifting to new business, the board considered a proposal from River Investment Properties LLC for a six-unit apartment building at 421 East Main Street. Engineer Peter Beimis presented plans to replace an existing non-conforming structure with a three-story building, seeking variances for lot area and special permits for setbacks and parking. He argued the project aligns with the A2 zoning district's multi-family character and reduces floor area ratio from 1.03 to 0.86 while adding on-site parking. However, board members noted recent zoning updates that allow three units by right (plus an accessory dwelling unit for four total), questioning the need for six. Neighbors opposed via letter, citing over-density and traffic woes. Recognizing the petition's misalignment with updated rules, the board tabled it at Beimis's request, allowing time for revisions—potentially scaling back to four units.</p>
        <p>In contrast, a related petition from the same developer for a two-unit townhome at 756 Second Street advanced smoothly. Beimis sought variances for lot dimensions, setbacks, and parking on a 3,630-square-foot non-conforming lot. The board granted approval unanimously, with a condition prohibiting additional accessory dwelling units, noting the proposal fits the neighborhood's pre-existing patterns without detriment.</p>
        <p>A straightforward after-the-fact variance came from Jeffrey Johnson at 4 Bronson Street, where a recently built deck violated rear yard setbacks. Johnson explained it as an oversight during renovations. The board approved unanimously, emphasizing compliance moving forward.</p>
        <p>The meeting's final petition involved Swall River Auto Repair LLC seeking to reinstate an automobile repair use at 30 B Street, dormant since 2019. Jeff Tolman noted the property's 40-year history as a maintenance facility and its well-maintained state. Neighbor Virginia Turkot supported the revival, highlighting no past issues and private street maintenance. With no opposition, the board approved unanimously, restoring the commercial use in a mixed residential-general district.</p>
        <p>Public engagement was notable, with residents like those near Rock Street actively participating to voice safety and congestion fears, underscoring local investment in zoning decisions. The board's actions—denials, approvals, and tablings—illustrated a methodical approach, often tying outcomes to state laws like the Dover Amendment and recent local reforms aimed at easing housing development. For instance, the A2 district updates have halved lot size requirements, enabling more by-right projects and reducing variance needs, as seen in the tabled six-unit proposal.</p>
        <p>Overall, the session processed diverse requests efficiently, with conditions like no further subdivisions or ADUs ensuring long-term compliance. Outcomes like the Little Hands denial may spark appeals, while approvals signal support for adaptive reuse in Fall River's evolving landscape. As the city grapples with housing shortages and business needs, these decisions reflect the ongoing tension between preservation and progress, setting the stage for future petitions to build on this framework.</p>

        <h1 id="article-title">Fall River Traffic Board Approves Curb Cuts, Handicap Spots</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="article-body">
                <p># Fall River Traffic Board Tackles Curb Cuts, Parking Changes, and Handicap Requests in Latest Meeting</p>
        <p>In its November 19 meeting, the Fall River Traffic Board greenlit several curb cut applications and handicap parking spots while addressing infrastructure tweaks tied to the ongoing Route 79 reconstruction project. The session highlighted the board's role in balancing resident needs with city engineering standards, approving most requests after reviewing paperwork and site conditions, though a few were tabled or denied based on specific circumstances.</p>
        <p>The meeting kicked off with curb cut approvals, starting with a request from Michael and Elizabeth Lemouth at 202 Cambridge Street. The property already has an 18-foot curb opening on M Street, and the applicants sought an additional 14-foot opening on Cambridge Street, bringing the total to 32 feet. City engineers reviewed the site and found no issues, leading to unanimous approval. Similarly, Jessica Ortega Regillis requested an extension at 3436 California Street, expanding an existing 12-foot opening by 19 feet to a total of 31 feet. Again, engineering checks raised no objections, and the board approved it without debate.</p>
        <p>Shifting to parking regulations, the board considered changes prompted by the Route 79 reconstruction under MassDOT's oversight. A key item was prohibiting parking on the north side of Breman Street at Lindsay Street, a stipulation from MassDOT to ensure smooth project execution. Most of Breman Street already has no-parking rules on that side, but this extension aims to facilitate turns, particularly for fire department vehicles. Fire Chief Bacon inspected the area with apparatus and recommended about 75 feet of restricted parking from Lindsay Street. The board also approved reverting Breman Street from one-way to two-way between Lindsay Street and McDonald Street, another adjustment tied to the highway work. These changes reflect the broader impact of the Route 79 project on local traffic flow, with board members noting the street's history as two-way before prior modifications.</p>
        <p>Handicap parking requests formed the bulk of the agenda, drawing public participation from several residents who attended to explain their situations. At 278 Franklin Street, the applicant, a tenant without off-street parking, presented valid placard and registration paperwork. The board inspected the site and approved the spot, emphasizing that such spaces are open to anyone with a valid placard, not reserved exclusively for the applicant. Installation is expected in about 12 weeks, pending ordinance and full council approval.</p>
        <p>Another approval came for 609 Eastern Avenue, where tenant Irene Costa lacks driveway access despite a small one on the property, as confirmed by her landlord. The board reviewed the paperwork and site, finding no issues, and passed the request. Similarly, at 529 June Street, tenant Mr. Lev provided documentation showing no garage access, leading to approval after a site visit confirmed the details.</p>
        <p>Public engagement was evident in cases like 54 Garfield Street, where homeowner Mr. Sadena sought a spot due to mobility challenges from recent knee replacements and a past fall in snow. The property has a narrow 7-foot driveway shared with a three-tenement building, making access difficult, especially in winter. Board members discussed the safety concerns, noting the applicant would need to walk around the house to reach the driveway. After weighing the tight space and the applicant's age of 85, the board approved the spot via roll call, with one opposing vote. They stressed that once installed, the applicant cannot use the driveway for parking, or the spot could be rescinded.</p>
        <p>Not all requests sailed through. A handicap spot at 202 Cambridge Street, linked to a prior curb cut approval, was denied after being tabled from the previous meeting; the applicant withdrew interest. Several others were tabled due to absent applicants, including those at 245 Corey Street for Maria Cado, 189 Trip Street for Kenneth Brunell, 299 Monttop Street for Lois Miranda (listed twice), and 1370 Rodman Street for Stephanie. The board requires applicants to attend for direct discussion, underscoring the importance of personal input in these decisions.</p>
        <p>At 820 Dwelli Street, a tenant without a driveway secured approval after paperwork checks and site visits confirmed compliance. For 6 Balo Street, tenant Mr. Kodega explained his landlord denies driveway access, and the corner location adds parking challenges. The board approved it, noting the area's relatively low traffic but acknowledging potential complaints from neighbors.</p>
        <p>The meeting wrapped with the rescinding of several outdated handicap spots no longer in use due to residents moving, stopping driving, or passing away. Affected addresses include 32299 South Oxford Street, 11399 Monttop Street, 55204 Eastern Avenue, 101202 President Avenue, and 113203 Maple Street. This cleanup helps free up street space, aligning with the board's efforts to manage parking efficiently.</p>
        <p>Throughout the session, board members like Stephanie MacArthur, Natalie Melo, Helen Rigo, John Le Point, and Thomas Farris from the police department emphasized thorough reviews, including site visits at various times to verify conditions. Residents actively participated, sharing personal stories about mobility issues and landlord restrictions, which influenced outcomes in several cases. These discussions illustrate how local traffic decisions often hinge on individual circumstances while adhering to city guidelines and broader projects like Route 79. With approvals now heading to ordinance review, affected residents can expect changes in the coming months, potentially easing daily challenges in Fall River's neighborhoods.</p>

                <p>### Fall River's Hidden History: Commission Reviews Bio Reserve Survey and Greenlights Preservation Projects</p>
        <p>In a meeting that bridged Fall River's forgotten rural past with its ongoing preservation challenges, the city's Historical Commission heard a detailed report on a cultural resource survey in the Southeastern Massachusetts Bio Reserve. The session, held on November 18, also saw approvals for several local projects aimed at maintaining historic structures, underscoring the commission's role in balancing heritage with practical upkeep.</p>
        <p>The highlight was a presentation by representatives from the Public Archaeology Laboratory (PAL), who outlined findings from a Community Preservation Act-funded survey of historic sites in the bio reserve and nearby Steep Brook area. Mike Labossiere, the city's forester for the Watuppa Reservation, set the stage by emphasizing the area's layered history, from indigenous use to 19th-century farms and mills. He noted how the reserve's vast, protected lands—spanning about 5,000 acres of watershed and additional conservation areas—have preserved evidence of human activity that urban development erased elsewhere in Fall River.</p>
        <p>PAL's Holly Herbster and Laura Klein detailed their reconnaissance-level work, which involved mapping and documenting over 60 resources without excavation. They identified farmsteads, mill sites, quarries, Civilian Conservation Corps features from the 1930s, and family burial grounds, mostly dating from the early 1800s to the mid-20th century. The survey excluded indigenous sites to respect tribal input for future phases, focusing instead on European settlement remnants like stone walls, foundations, and bridges. They prepared inventory forms for the Massachusetts Historical Commission, recommending two areas—the Blossom Farm/Watuppa Reservation Headquarters and the Adirondack Farm—for potential National Register of Historic Places listing due to their agricultural and conservation significance.</p>
        <p>Audience questions revealed local curiosity about the reserve's value. One resident asked about balancing preservation with development, prompting Labossiere to explain that most of the 14,000- to 15,000-acre bio reserve is permanently protected for water quality and recreation, with little room for new building. Another inquired about extending surveys to private lands abutting the reserve, leading to discussions on legal sensitivities and future possibilities. The commission and presenters stressed collaboration with Wampanoag tribal members for indigenous history, though none attended, leaving that phase open-ended.</p>
        <p>Shifting to city business, the commission approved several applications, each tied to maintaining Fall River's architectural heritage. At 162 French Street, a property in the 40C historic district, owner Manuel Furtado received permission to replace and extend a rear porch, provided materials like pressure-treated wood spindles and paintable composite rails match existing designs and adhere to Secretary of the Interior standards. The decision reflected the commission's emphasis on in-kind replacements to preserve neighborhood character.</p>
        <p>Reverend Hornsby of St. Luke's Episcopal Church sought support for repointing the church's granite tower and nave, estimated at $150,000 to $250,000, to address water damage from cracks. The commission granted a letter of support for Community Preservation Committee funding, conditional on following historic guidelines, highlighting the 1897 structure's National Register status.</p>
        <p>Grace Gerling from Greater Fall River Recreation presented plans to replace 67 windows at the old Second District Courthouse, now a community center. The commission approved support for CPC funding, ensuring the new windows unify the building's appearance and meet preservation standards, without security bars to restore its original look.</p>
        <p>Finally, Christopher Donovan of the Eagle Restaurant and Event Center outlined restoring original oak windows on the second floor and replicating others on the third, part of reviving the 1930 building's historic facade. The commission provided a letter of support, praising the effort to return elements like window boxes to their pre-1930s state.</p>
        <p>Public engagement was evident throughout, with residents probing the bio reserve's educational potential and its role as a "cultural landscape" preserving 10,000 years of history. Presenters noted the area's uniqueness in New England for its contiguous, undeveloped land, offering a contrast to Fall River's industrial core. No emergencies were discussed, but the meeting touched on ongoing efforts like the Highlands Local Historic District update, where PAL aims to complete fieldwork by early December and deliver drafts by late January, with a final report expected in April.</p>
        <p>These decisions illustrate Fall River's methodical approach to stewardship, where surveys like the bio reserve project inform broader preservation strategies. By documenting rural relics and approving targeted repairs, the commission ensures the city's history remains accessible, even as modern needs evolve. As one attendee noted, the reserve's trails already draw hikers, hinting at untapped potential for community connection to this preserved past.</p>
